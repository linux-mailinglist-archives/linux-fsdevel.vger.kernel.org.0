Oops, typo. I was asking whether the buffer rings (not buffers) are
supposed to be used with other requests. E.g. submitting a
IORING_OP_RECV with IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT set and the bgid specifying
your kernel-managed buffer ring.

There are two separate arguments. The first is about not making buffers
inseparable from buffer rings in the io_uring user API. Whether it's
IORING_REGISTER_MEM_REGION or something else is not that important.
I have no objection if it's a part of fuse instead though, e.g. if
fuse binds two objects together when you register it with fuse, or even
if fuse create a buffer ring internally (assuming it doesn't indirectly
leak into io_uring uapi).

And the second was about optionally allowing user memory for buffer
creation as you're reusing the region abstraction. You can find pros
and cons for both modes, and funnily enough, SQ/CQ were first kernel
allocated and then people asked for backing it by user memory, and IIRC
it was in the reverse order for pbuf rings.

Implementing this is trivial as well, you just need to pass an argument
while creating a region. All new region users use struct
io_uring_region_desc for uapi and forward it to io_create_region()
without caring if it's user or kernel allocated memory.

The stress is on why it's an _io_uring_ API. It doesn't matter to me
whether it's a separate opcode or not. Currently, buffer rings don't give
you anything that can't be pure fuse, and it might be simpler to have
it implemented in fuse than binding to some io_uring object. Or it could
create buffer rings internally to reuse code but it doesn't become an
io_uring uapi but rather implementation detail. And that predicates on
whether km rings are intended to be used with other / non-fuse requests.

I believe the source of disagreement is that you're thinking
about how it's going to look like for fuse specifically, and I
believe you that it'll be nicer for the fuse use case. However,
on the other hand it's an io_uring uapi, and if it is an io_uring
uapi, we need reusable blocks that are not specific to particular
users.

If it km rings has to stay an io_uring uapi, I guess a middle
ground would be to allow registering km rings together with memory,
but make it a pure region without a notion of a buffer, and let
fuse to chunk it. Later, we can make payload memory allocation
optional.

Right, intentionally so, because otherwise it's a fuse uapi that
pretends to be a generic io_uring uapi but it's not because of
all assumptions in different places.

Not really, it tells the buffer ring depth but says nothing about
how much memory user space allocated and how it's pushed. It's a
reasonable default but they could be different. For example, if you
expect adding more memory at runtime, you might create the buffer
ring a bit larger. Or when server processing takes a while and you
can't recycle until it finishes, you might have more buffers than
you need ring entries. Or you might might decide to split buffers
and as you mentioned incremental consumption, which is an entire
separate topic because it doesn't do de-fragmentation and you'd
need to have it in fuse, just like user space does with pbufs.

My entire point is that we're making lots of assumptions for io_uring
uapi, and if it's moved to fuse because it knows better what it
needs, it should be a win.

IOW, it sounds better if instead of passing the number of buffers to
io_uring, you just ask it to create a large chunk of memory, and then
fuse chunks it up and puts into the ring.

I agree, and you'd need something new in either case to add more
memory, and it doesn't need to be IORING_REGISTER_MEM_REGION
specifically.

Unregistering a buffer ring doesn't guarantee that there are no
inflight requests that are still using buffers that came out of
the buffer ring. The fuse driver can wait/terminate its requests
before unregisteration, but allow userspace issued IORING_OP_RECV
to use this km buffer ring, and you'll need to somehow synchronise
with all other io_uring requests.
