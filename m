The functions are implemented under 'include/linux/', indistinguishable from
exported APIs. I think I understand why they are there, but they look the same
as exported functions from a driver perspective.

Perhaps I'm being daft, but I'm totally missing why I should care if swiotlb
leverages this feature. If you're using that, you've traded performance for
security or compatibility already. If this idea can be used to make it perform
better, then great, but that shouldn't be the reason to hold this up IMO.

This optimization needs to be easy to reach if we expect anyone to use it.
Working with arbitrary user addresses with minimal additions to the user ABI
was deliberate. If you want a special allocator, we can always add one later;
this series doesn't affect that.

If this has potential to starve system resource though, I can constrain it to
specific users like CAP_SYS_ADMIN, or maybe only memory allocated from
hugetlbfs. Or perhaps a more complicated scheme of shuffling dma mapping
resources on demand if that is an improvement over the status quo.
