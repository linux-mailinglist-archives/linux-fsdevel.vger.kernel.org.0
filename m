If memcg ever gets enabled for all kernel side allocations we might
start seeing failures of GFP_KERNEL allocations.

I've got better fault injection code coming, I'll be posting it right
after memory allocation profiling gets merged - that'll help with the
testing situation.

The big blocker on enabling memcg for all kernel allocations is
performance overhead, but I hear that's getting worked on as well.

We'd probably want to add a gfp flag to annotate which allocations we
want to fail because of memcg, though...
