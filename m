I haven't thought about this yet. I agree we could look into it
further later on.

Off the top of my head, we may be able to have shrinker_info struct,
it should look like:

struct shrinker_info {
    atomic_long_t nr_deferred;
    /* Just one bit is used now */
    u8 map:1;
}

struct memcg_shrinker_info {
    struct rcu_head rcu;
    /* Indexed by shrinker ID */
    struct shrinker_info info[];
}

Then in struct mem_cgroup_per_node, we could have:

struct mem_cgroup_per_node {
    ....
    struct memcg_shrinker_info __rcu *shrinker_info;
    ....
}

In this way shrinker_info should be allocated to all memcgs, including
root. But shrinker could ignore root's map bit. We may waste a little
bit memory, but we get unification.

Would that work?
