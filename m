I was thinking more about it and the reasonable solution could be to use
following errno codes for these situations:

 EOPNOTSUPP - server or client does not support symlink operation
 EPERM - user does not have privilege / capability to create new symlink
 EACCES - user does not have (ACL) permission to create new symlink

But in this case it would be needed to extend symlink(2) manpage. It is
feasible? Or the meaning of EPERM is written in the stone, it means that
operation is not supported, and it cannot be changed?

For me it sounds a bug if EPERM means "not supported", and also "ln -s"
tool does not understand this EPERM error as it shows human readable
message "Operation not permitted" instead of "Operation not supported"
(which is the correct one in this situation).
