You need to have a security policy to reference to add a capability.
Telling the disc to spin in the opposite direction, while important
to control, is not something that will fall under a security policy.
It is also rare for programs to need CAP_SYS_ADMIN for only one thing.

While I agree that we shouldn't be allowing a program to reverse the
spin of a drive just because it needs to adjust memory use on a network
interface, I don't believe that capabilities are the right approach.
Capabilities haven't proven popular for their intended purpose, so I
don't see them as a good candidate for extension. There were good reasons
for capabilities to work the way they do, but they have not all stood
the test of time. I do have a proposed implementation, but it's stuck
behind LSM stacking.
