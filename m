I just realized there is a 4th option, which is to make vboxsf read_iter
simply always do:

4) Always evict non dirt pages from page-cache from read_iter, to ensure we
    get the latest version from the host:

So something like this:

	/*
          * Evict non dirt pages from page-cache, so that we reget them from
          * the host in case they have been changed.
          * /
	invalidate_mapping_pages(inode->i_mapping, pos >> PAGE_SHIFT,
				 (pos + len) >> PAGE_SHIFT);
         generic_file_read_iter(...)

This is in essence what the out of tree driver is doing on read(), except
that it does not go through the page-cache at all.

I think this might be the best option, perhaps controlled by a mount
flag ?

Regards,

Hans
