Thank you for the prompt response. I agree with you, for the next 
version I will implement such restrictions. I think it will be better to 
start with very restrict possibilities and then slowly dropping then, if 
they prove to be not problematic.

Ops, you are right, I forgot to tag it as such.

I haven't tried, I'm not sure which directory should I point to fstests 
to use for the test, the merged one?
