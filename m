Hi!

Just FYI, most of the Europe takes time off starting at mid-December up
until New Year due to Christmass and since most of the LTP patch
reviewers are located in Europe there is very little review done during
that period. As for LTP we are going to produce release soon as well, so
I can't promise I can have a look this or even the next week. Please be
patient.
