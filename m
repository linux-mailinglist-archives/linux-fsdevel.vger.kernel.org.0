I get all that.
But my understanding had been that the i_version value at the time of
ovl_copyattr() would be correct. Because when ovl_copyattr() is called
the expected i_version change will have been done in the relevant layer
includig raising the QUERIED bit. Since the layers are not allowed to be
changed outside of the overlayfs mount any change to them can only
originate from overlayfs which would necessarily call ovl_copyattr()
again. IOW, overlayfs would by virtue of its implementation keep the
i_version value in sync.

Overlayfs wouldn't even raise SB_I_VERSION. It would indeed just be a
cache of i_version of the relevant layer.

That seems reasonable to me. I read this as an agreeing with my earlier
suggestion to document that i_version doesn't have a meaning for the
inodes of stacking filesystems and that we should spell out that
vfs_getattr()/->getattr() needs to be used to interact with i_version.

We need to explain to subsystems such as IMA somwhere what the correct
way to query i_version agnostically is; independent of filesystem
implementation details.

Looking at IMA, it queries the i_version directly without checking
whether it's an IS_I_VERSION() inode first. This might make a
difference.

Afaict, filesystems that persist i_version to disk automatically raise
SB_I_VERSION. I would guess that it be considered a bug if a filesystem
would persist i_version to disk and not raise SB_I_VERSION. If so IMA
should probably be made to check for IS_I_VERSION() and it will probably
get that by switching to vfs_getattr_nosec().
