Please stop refering to "legacy users" of di_changecount. Whether
there are users or not is irrelevant - it is defined by the current
on-disk format specification, and as such there may be applications
we do not know about making use of the current behaviour.

It's like a linux syscall - we can't remove them because there may
be some user we don't know about still using that old syscall. We
simply don't make changes that can potentially break user
applications like that.

The on disk format is the same - there is software out that we don't
know about that expects a certain behaviour based on the
specification. We don't break the on disk format by making silent
behavioural changes - we require a feature flag to indicate
behaviour has changed so that applications can take appropriate
actions with stuff they don't understand.

The example for this is the BIGTIME timestamp format change. The on
disk inode structure is physically unchanged, but the contents of
the timestamp fields are encoded very differently. Sure, the older
kernels can read the timestamp data without any sort of problem
occurring, except for the fact the timestamps now appear to be
completely corrupted.

Changing the meaning of ithe contents of di_changecount is no
different. It might look OK and nothing crashes, but nothing can be
inferred from the value in the field because we don't know how it
has been modified.

Hence we can't just change the meaning, encoding or behaviour of an
on disk field that would result in existing kernels and applications
doing the wrong thing with that field (either read or write) without
adding a feature flag to indicate what behaviour that field should
have.

See above: redefining the contents, behaviour or encoding of an on
disk field is a change of the on-disk format specification.

The rules for on disk format changes that we work to were set in
place long before I started working on XFS.  They are sane, well
thought out rules that have stood the test of time and massive new
feature introductions (CRCs, reflink, rmap, etc). And they only work
because we don't allow anyone to bend them for convenience, short
cuts or expediting their pet project.

As I keep saying: this is largely irrelevant to the problem at hand.

> the i_version,

Yes.  XFS has a strong separation between on-disk structures and
in-memory values, and i_version is simply the in-memory field we use
to store the current di_changecount value.  We force bump i_version
every time we modify the inode core regardless of whether anyone has
queried i_version because that's what di_changecount requires. i.e.
the filesystem controls the contents of i_version, not the VFS.

Now that NFS is using a proper abstraction (i.e. vfs_statx()) to get
the change cookie, we really don't need to expose di_changecount in
i_version at all - we could simply copy an internal di_changecount
value into the statx cookie field in xfs_vn_getattr() and there
would be almost no change of behaviour from the perspective of NFS
and IMA at all.

Yup, both of those sort of applications exist. e.g. the DMAPI kernel
module allows direct access to inode metadata through a custom
bulkstat formatter implementation - it returns different information
comapred to the standard XFS one in the upstream kernel.

Yes, and one of those "tools" is *me*.

I frequently look at the di_changecount when doing forensic and/or
failure analysis on filesystem corpses.  SOE analysis, relative
modification activity, etc all give insight into what happened to
the filesystem to get it into the state it is currently in, and
di_changecount provides information no other metadata in the inode
contains.

xfs_db is the tool I use for this, such as:

$ sudo xfs_db -c "sb 0" -c "a rootino" -c "p v3.change_count" /dev/mapper/fast
v3.change_count = 35
$

The root inode in this filesystem has a change count of 35. The root
inode has 32 dirents in it, which means that no entries have ever
been removed or renamed. This sort of insight into the past history
of inode metadata is largely impossible to get any other way, and
it's been the difference between understanding failure and having no
clue more than once.

Most block device parsing applications simply write their own
decoder that walks the on-disk format. That's pretty trivial to do,
developers can get all the information needed to do this from the
on-disk format specification documentation we keep on kernel.org...
