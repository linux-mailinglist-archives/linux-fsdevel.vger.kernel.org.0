Your out-of-seq command would be none of io_urings business, outside of
the fact that we'd need to ensure it's stable if we need to postpone
it. So yes, that would be fine, it just means your actual command is
passed in as a pointer, and you would be responsible for copying it
in for execution

We're going to need something to handle postponing, and something
for ensuring that eg cancelations free the allocated memory.

It's io_uring-fops.v2 for now, use that one.
