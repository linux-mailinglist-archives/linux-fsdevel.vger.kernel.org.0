So with inotify event, you get back 'wd' and 'name' to identify the object
where the event happened. How is this (for your usecase) different from
getting back 'fsid + handle' and 'name' back from fanotify? In inotify case
you had to somehow track wd -> path linkage, with fanotify you need to
track 'fsid + handle' -> path linkage.

For your particular usecase I don't think there's any advantage of
fsid+fhandle over plain wd. But if you want to monitor multiple filesystems
or if you have priviledged process that can open by handle, or a standard
filesystem where handles are actually persistent, then there are benefits.
