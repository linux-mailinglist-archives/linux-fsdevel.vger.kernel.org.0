From my opinion, the semantics of NOWAIT is clear, just like Jens said,
"don't wait, if**avoidable**". Also it should be the responsibility of
the callers who set this flag to resubmit the failed IO once a -EAGAIN
returned. e.g. if the user app sets RWF_NOWAIT, then it's the
responsibility of the user app to resubmit the failed IO once -EAGAIN
returned. If io_uring layer newly set IOCB_NONBLOCK flag, then it's the
responsibility of io_uring to resubmit.

The limitation here is that once a big DIO/bio got split, then the
atomicity of whole DIO/bio can not be guaranteed. This seems a
limitation of direct IO routine and block layer, and the work of above
layers e.g. filesystem, is needed to guarantee the atomicity.
