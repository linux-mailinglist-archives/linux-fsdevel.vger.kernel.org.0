Excellent explanation! Thanks a lot.

Still some questions below.

1. Actually I'm quite not clear on what you called "partial submission
or completion". Even when REQ_NOWAIT is set for all split bios of one
DIO, then all these split bios are **submitted** to block layer through
submit_bio(). Even when one split bio after the first one failed
**inside** submit_bio() because of REQ_NOWAIT, submit_bio() only returns
BLK_QC_T_NONE, and the DIO layer (such as __blkdev_direct_IO()) will
still call submit_bio() for the remaining split bios. And then only when
all split bios complete, will the whole kiocb complete.

So if you define "submission" as submitting to hardware disk (such as
nvme device driver), then it is indeed **partial submission** when
REQ_NOWAIT set. But if the definition of "submission" is actually
"submitting to block layer by calling submit_bio()", then all split bios
of one DIO are indeed submitted to block layer, even when one split bio
gets BLK_STS_AGAIN because of REQ_NOWIAT.


2. One DIO could be split into multiple bios in DIO layer. Similarly one
big bio could be split into multiple bios in block layer. In the
situation when all split bios have already been submitted to block
layer, since the IO completion interface could return only one error
code, the whole DIO could fail as long as one split bio fails, while
several other split bios could have already succeeded and the
corresponding disk sectors have already been overwritten. I'm not sure
if this is what you called "silent partial writes", and if this is the
core reason for commit 883a790a8440 ("xfs: don't allow NOWAIT DIO across
extent boundaries") you mentioned in previous mail.

If this is the case, then it seems that the IO completion interface
should be blamed for this issue. Besides REQ_NOWIAT, there may be more
situations that will cause "silent partial writes".

As long as one split bios could fail (besides EAGAIN, maybe EOPNOTSUPP,
if possible), while other split bios may still succeeds, then the error
of one split bio will still override the completion status of the whole
DIO. In this case "silent partial writes" is still possible? In my
understanding, passing REQ_NOWAIT flags from IOCB_NOWAIT in DIO layer
only makes the problem more likely to happen, but it's not the only
source of this problem?

Don't know the initial intention and history of IOCB_NOWAIT. Learned a
lot. Thanks.
