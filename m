Agreed.  The problem are the block layer semantics.  iomap/xfs really
just is the messenger here.

And for something that has a real block allocator it could also be
entirely dynamic.  But I'm not sure if dm-thinp or bcache do anything
like that at the moment.

Exactly.  Either they need to be reported synchronously, or maybe we
need a block layer hook in bio_endio that retries the given bio on a
workqueue without ever bubbling up to the caller.  But allowing delayed
BLK_STS_AGAIN is going to mess up any non-trivial caller.  But even
for the plain block device is will cause duplicate I/O where some
blocks have already been read/written and then will get resubmitted.

I'm not sure that breaks any atomicity assumptions as we don't really
give explicit ones for block devices (except maybe for the new
RWF_ATOMIC flag?), but it certainly is unexpected and suboptimal.
