I don't have a complete understanding of this area, but my thought was
not that we would look for any buffer full condition, but rather that
an iterator could be tested for next_entry == EOF.

Certainly it could be added later, but I wanted to make sure some thought
was put into it now.  It would be nice to have it sooner rather than later
though...
