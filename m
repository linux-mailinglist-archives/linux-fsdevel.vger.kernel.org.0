Yes, the match is correct. I was thinking more of the bits being needed
for other use-case that could collide with append. We considered this
and discard it for being messy - when Pavel brought up the 512B
alignment we saw it as a good alternative.

Note too that we would be able to translate to a byte offset in
iouring.h too so the user would not need to think of this.

I do not feel strongly on this, so the one that better fits the current
and near-future for uring, that is the one we will send on V3. Will give
it until next week for others to comment too.

Yes. I think already max zone sizes are pretty huge. But yes, this might
change, so we will take it when it happens.
