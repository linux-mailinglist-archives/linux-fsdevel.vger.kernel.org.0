I'm not going to debate AT_EMPTY_PATH with NULL again. This particular
hedgehog can never be buggered at all (anymore).

The fdsyscall() and fdatsyscall() is an ancient debate as well. In
principle for most use-cases its possible to get away with openat(fd,
path) and then most other system calls could very likely just fd-based.

So one could argue "fsck fdatsyscall()s" and refuse to add them. That of
course will ignore everyone who doesn't want to or cannot open the file
they want to operate on which is not super common but common enough.
O_PATH won't save them in all cases because they might need a file with
proper file_operations not empty_fops set.

The other thing is that this forces everyone to allocate a file for
every operation they do and returning it to userspace and then closing
it again. It's annoying and also very costly for a bunch of use-cases.

Ok, so the other option is that we just merge fdsyscall()s whenever
someone needs to really not be bothered with passing a path and we also
merge fdatsyscall() whenever someone needs to be able to lookup. I
personally hate this and I'm sure we'd get some questions form Linus why
we always merge two variants.

But ok we'd probably handle the fdsyscall()/fdatsyscall() split
gracefully enough by separating pure fdsyscall() vfs_*() helpers and
fdatsyscall() vfs_*() helpers and come up with a scheme that doesn't
lead to too much fragementation in how we handle this.

And that is at the core of the issue for me:

(1) We try to reduce the number of helpers that we have internally as
    much as possible.
(2) We try to reduce the number of special paths that code can take as
    much as possible.

This is vital. It is a long-term survival and sanity question. Because
we have again and again observed endless fragmentation in the number of
helpers and number of special-cases. They will keep coming and someone
needs to understand them all.

The price is high, very very high in the long-term. Because if we don't
pay close attention we suddenly end up with 10 helpers for the same
thing, 5 of which inexplicably end up being exported to 15 random
modules of which 5 abuse it. So now we need to clean this up - tree
wide. Fun times.

Same with special-cases.

So yes, there's a trade-off where taking the additional hit of an atomic
or refcount is done because it collapses a bunch of special-cases into a
single case. And that may have an impact on some workloads. If that gets
reported we always try to figure out an acceptable solution and we
almost always do.

Your work is actually a good example of this. You _should be_ (note the
_should_) a pain in our sweet little behinds :) because in some sense a
lot of your requests are "If we make this a special-case and add a tiny
helper for it then we elide an atomic in this and that condition for the
single-threaded use-case.". So you are always on the border of pushing
against (1) and (2). That's fine and your work is great and needed and
we seem to always fine a good way to make it acceptable.
