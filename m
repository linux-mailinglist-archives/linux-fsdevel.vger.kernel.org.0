Please see my comments to patch 04.
We should only implement copy-offload if there is a dedicated 
infrastructure in place. But we should not have a 'generic' copy-offload 
emulation.
Problem is that 'real' copy-offload functionalities (ie for NVMe or 
SCSI) are riddled with corner-cases where copy-offload does _not_ work,
and where commands might fail if particular conditions are not met.
Falling back to a generic implementation will cause applications to 
assume that copy-offload worked, and that it gained performance as
the application just had to issue a single command.
Whereas in fact the opposite is true; it wasn't a single command, and 
the application might have performed better by issuing the commands
itself.
Returning -EOPNOTSUPP in these cases will inform the application that 
the attempt didn't work, and that it will have to fall back to the
'normal' copy.

Cheers,

Hannes
