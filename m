The reason I liked the putname() is that it's unconditional - the caller
can rely on it being put, regardless of the return value. So I'd say the
same should be true for ctx.kvalue, and if not, the caller should still
free it. That's the path of least surprise - no leak for the least
tested error path, and no UAF in the success case.

For the put case, most other abstractions end up being something ala:

helper(struct file *file, ...)
{
	actual actions
}

regular_sys_call(int fd, ...)
{
	struct fd f;
	int ret = -EBADF;

	f = fdget(fd);
	if (f.file) {
		ret = helper(f.file, ...);
		fdput(f();
	}

	return ret;
}

where io_uring will use helper(), and where the file reference is
assumed to be valid for helper() and helper() will not put a reference
to it.

That's a bit different than your putname() case, but I think as long as
it's consistent regardless of return value, then either approach is
fine. Maybe just add a comment about that? At least for the consistent
case, if it blows up, it'll blow up instantly rather than be a surprise
down the line for "case x,y,z doesn't put it" or "case x,y,z always puts
in, normal one does not".

Fully agree.

Right, it could be allowed for fgetxattr on the io_uring side. Anything
that passes in a struct file would be fair game to enable it on.
Anything that passes in a path (eg a non-fd value), it obviously
wouldn't make sense anyway.

That is pretty darn accurate. The ordering of the rsrc nodes and the
break ensure that it stays valid until anything using it has completed.
And yes it would be nice to document that code a bit, but honestly I'd
much rather just make it more obviously referenced if that can be done
cheaply enough. For now, I'll add some comments, and hope you do the
same on your side! Because I don't ever remember seeing an Al comment.
Great emails, for sure, but not really comments.
