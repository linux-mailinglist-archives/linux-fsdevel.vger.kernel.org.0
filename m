Cc Jens and io_uring list

For ublk:

1) it is MQ device, it is natural to map queue into pthread/uring

2) io_uring context is invisible to driver, we don't know when it is destructed,
so bind io_uring context with queue/pthread, because we have to complete all
uring commands before io_uring context exits. uring cmd usage for ublk/fuse should
be special and unique, and it is like poll request, and sent to device beforehand,
and it is completed only if driver has incoming thing which needs userspace to handle,
but ublk/fuse may never have anyting which needs userpace to look.

If io_uring can provides API for registering exit callback, things could be easier
for ublk/fuse. However, we still need to know the exact io_uring context associated
with our commands, so either more io_uring implementation details exposed to driver,
or proper APIs provided.

io uring is used for submitting multiple files, so its lifetime can't be bound
to file, also io_uring is invisible to driver if here the ring(s) means io_uring.
