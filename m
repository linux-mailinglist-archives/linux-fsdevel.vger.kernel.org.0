Please see the patchset:

The patchset does cover the sparse backfile, and I also provide one test
case in which one completely sparse file is used, and make sure that
there isn't regression in this case.

This patchset is supposed to address Mikulas's case of stable FS mapping,
meantime without introducing regression on other cases, such as
the sparse backing file.

OK, will Cc you and linux-fsdevel in future loop patch submission.
