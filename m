From: David Hildenbrand <david@redhat.com>

People want to make use of more THPs, for example, moving from
the "never" system policy to "madvise", or from "madvise" to "always".

While this is great news for every THP desperately waiting to get
allocated out there, apparently there are some workloads that require a
bit of care during that transition: individual processes may need to
opt-out from this behavior for various reasons, and this should be
permitted without needing to make all other workloads on the system
similarly opt-out.

The following scenarios are imaginable:

(1) Switch from "none" system policy to "madvise"/"always", but keep THPs
    disabled for selected workloads.

(2) Stay at "none" system policy, but enable THPs for selected
    workloads, making only these workloads use the "madvise" or "always"
    policy.

(3) Switch from "madvise" system policy to "always", but keep the
    "madvise" policy for selected workloads: allocate THPs only when
    advised.

(4) Stay at "madvise" system policy, but enable THPs even when not advised
    for selected workloads -- "always" policy.

Once can emulate (2) through (1), by setting the system policy to
"madvise"/"always" while disabling THPs for all processes that don't want
THPs. It requires configuring all workloads, but that is a user-space
problem to sort out.

(4) can be emulated through (3) in a similar way.

Back when (1) was relevant in the past, as people started enabling THPs,
we added PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, so relevant workloads that were not ready
yet (i.e., used by Redis) were able to just disable THPs completely. Redis
still implements the option to use this interface to disable THPs
completely.

With PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, we added a way to force-disable THPs for a
workload -- a process, including fork+exec'ed process hierarchy.
That essentially made us support (1): simply disable THPs for all workloads
that are not ready for THPs yet, while still enabling THPs system-wide.

The quest for handling (3) and (4) started, but current approaches
(completely new prctl, options to set other policies per process,
alternatives to prctl -- mctrl, cgroup handling) don't look particularly
promising. Likely, the future will use bpf or something similar to
implement better policies, in particular to also make better decisions
about THP sizes to use, but this will certainly take a while as that work
just started.

Long story short: a simple enable/disable is not really suitable for the
future, so we're not willing to add completely new toggles.

While we could emulate (3)+(4) through (1)+(2) by simply disabling THPs
completely for these processes, this is a step backwards, because these
processes can no longer allocate THPs in regions where THPs were
explicitly advised: regions flagged as VM_HUGEPAGE. Apparently, that
imposes a problem for relevant workloads, because "not THPs" is certainly
worse than "THPs only when advised".

Could we simply relax PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, to "disable THPs unless not
explicitly advised by the app through MAD_HUGEPAGE"? *maybe*, but this
would change the documented semantics quite a bit, and the versatility
to use it for debugging purposes, so I am not 100% sure that is what we
want -- although it would certainly be much easier.

So instead, as an easy way forward for (3) and (4), add an option to
make PR_SET_THP_DISABLE disable *less* THPs for a process.

In essence, this patch:

(A) Adds PR_THP_DISABLE_EXCEPT_ADVISED, to be used as a flag in arg3
    of prctl(PR_SET_THP_DISABLE) when disabling THPs (arg2 != 0).

    prctl(PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, 1, PR_THP_DISABLE_EXCEPT_ADVISED).

(B) Makes prctl(PR_GET_THP_DISABLE) return 3 if
    PR_THP_DISABLE_EXCEPT_ADVISED was set while disabling.

    Previously, it would return 1 if THPs were disabled completely. Now
    it returns the set flags as well: 3 if PR_THP_DISABLE_EXCEPT_ADVISED
    was set.

(C) Renames MMF_DISABLE_THP to MMF_DISABLE_THP_COMPLETELY, to express
    the semantics clearly.

    Fortunately, there are only two instances outside of prctl() code.

(D) Adds MMF_DISABLE_THP_EXCEPT_ADVISED to express "no THP except for VMAs
    with VM_HUGEPAGE" -- essentially "thp=madvise" behavior

    Fortunately, we only have to extend vma_thp_disabled().

(E) Indicates "THP_enabled: 0" in /proc/pid/status only if THPs are
    disabled completely

    Only indicating that THPs are disabled when they are really disabled
    completely, not only partially.

    For now, we don't add another interface to obtained whether THPs
    are disabled partially (PR_THP_DISABLE_EXCEPT_ADVISED was set). If
    ever required, we could add a new entry.

The documented semantics in the man page for PR_SET_THP_DISABLE
"is inherited by a child created via fork(2) and is preserved across
execve(2)" is maintained. This behavior, for example, allows for
disabling THPs for a workload through the launching process (e.g.,
systemd where we fork() a helper process to then exec()).

For now, MADV_COLLAPSE will *fail* in regions without VM_HUGEPAGE and
VM_NOHUGEPAGE. As MADV_COLLAPSE is a clear advise that user space
thinks a THP is a good idea, we'll enable that separately next
(requiring a bit of cleanup first).

There is currently not way to prevent that a process will not issue
PR_SET_THP_DISABLE itself to re-enable THP. There are not really known
users for re-enabling it, and it's against the purpose of the original
interface. So if ever required, we could investigate just forbidding to
re-enable them, or make this somehow configurable.

At first, I thought of "why not simply relax PR_SET_THP_DISABLE", but I
think there might be real use cases where we want to disable any THPs --
in particular also around debugging THP-related problems, and
"never" not meaning ... "never" anymore ever since we add MADV_COLLAPSE.
PR_SET_THP_DISABLE will also block MADV_COLLAPSE, which can be very
helpful for debugging purposes. Of course, I thought of having a
system-wide config option to modify PR_SET_THP_DISABLE behavior, but
I just don't like the semantics.

"prctl: allow overriding system THP policy to always"[1] proposed
"overriding policies to always", which is just the wrong way around: we
should not add mechanisms to "enable more" when we already have an
interface/mechanism to "disable" them (PR_SET_THP_DISABLE). It all gets
weird otherwise.

"[PATCH 0/6] prctl: introduce PR_SET/GET_THP_POLICY"[2] proposed
setting the default of the VM_HUGEPAGE, which is similarly the wrong way
around I think now.

The ideas explored by Lorenzo to extend process_madvise()[3] and mctrl()[4]
similarly were around the "default for VM_HUGEPAGE" idea, but after the
discussion, I think we should better leave VM_HUGEPAGE untouched.

Happy to hear naming suggestions for "PR_THP_DISABLE_EXCEPT_ADVISED" where
we essentially want to say "leave advised regions alone" -- "keep THP
enabled for advised regions",

The only thing I really dislike about this is using another MMF_* flag,
but well, no way around it -- and seems like we could easily support
more than 32 if we want to (most users already treat it like a proper
bitmap).

I think this here (modifying an existing toggle) is the only prctl()
extension that we might be willing to accept. In general, I agree like
most others, that prctl() is a very bad interface for that -- but
PR_SET_THP_DISABLE is already there and is getting used.

Long-term, I think the answer will be something based on bpf[5]. Maybe
in that context, I there could still be value in easily disabling THPs for
selected workloads (esp. debugging purposes).

Jann raised valid concerns[6] about new flags that are persistent across
exec[6]. As this here is a relaxation to existing PR_SET_THP_DISABLE I
consider it having a similar security risk as our existing
PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, but devil is in the detail.
