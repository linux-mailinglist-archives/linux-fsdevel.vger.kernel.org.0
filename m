Thanks, I appreciate that!

Sure, you won't agree with everything. That's kinda expected for reasons
of preference alone but also simply because there's a lot of stuff that
probably only you know atm. In general, I never pick up any stuff I
can't review myself unless it's in-your-face obvious or it already has
acks from the subject matter experts.

But it is much easier to help maintain vfs stuff now that you made it
clear that you're ok with this. So I'm happy to share more of the vfs
maintenance workload.
