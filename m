I see now, thanks for explanation! But one thing still is not clear to me.
If you say have a snapshot mounted read-write and then you mount the
current snapshot (cno == 0) read-only, you'll switch the whole superblock
to read-only state. So also the mounted snapshot is suddently read-only
which is unexpected and actually supposedly breaks things because you can
still have file handles open for writing on the snapshot etc.. So how do
you solve that?
