That's a new take...

Honestly - no.

Userspace would really like to see some sort of definition for this kind
of behaviour, and if we just change things underneath them without
telling anyone, _that's a dick move_.

POSIX_FADV_TORN_RW is a terrible name, though.

And fadvise() is the wrong API for this because it applies to ranges,
this should be an open flag or an fcntl.
