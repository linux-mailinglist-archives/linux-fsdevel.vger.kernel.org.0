Yeah it does, in my fuse-dio-v5 branch, which adds in shared locks for 
O_DIRECT writes without FOPEN_DIRECT_IO.

No issue with that, I can keep that patch on the branch that actually 
needs it.

Oh, I just see your comments - I didn't get github notification and so 
missed your comments before. Sorry about that. Checking where I need to 
enable it. I do get notifications for other projects, so didn't suspect 
that anything would be missing...

I definitely would also like to get these patches in. Holidays have the 
merit that I don't need to get up at 7am to wake up kids and am then 
tired all the day. And no meetings ;)

 From my point my dio-v5 branch is also ready, it relies on these 
patches. Not sure how to post it with the dependency.
I also have no issue to wait for 6.9, for now I'm going to take these 
patches to our fuse module for ubuntu and rhel9 kernels (quite heavily 
patched, as it needs to live aside the kernel included module - symbol 
renames, etc).

Sure, fine with me. I'm just a bit worried that others might get 
disturbed by all the fuse only messages.


Thanks,
