This is subtle and it took me a couple of minutes to get it at first.
Currently cmds_attrs holds an array of pointers into the command buffer,
with every pointer being the beginning of the tlv_header, whilst with
your change cmd_attr now holds actual btrfs_send_attribute structures
(52 bytes vs sizeof(uintptr_t)  bytes before). So this increases the
overall size of btrfs_send_stream because with  your version of the code
you parse the type/length fields and store them directly in the send
attribute structure at command parse time rather than just referring to
the raw command buffer during read_cmd and referring to them during
attribute parsing.

This might seem superficial but this kind of change should really be
mentioned explicitly in the changelog to better prepare reviewers what
to expect.


OTOH the code LGTM and actually now it seems less tricky than before so:

David if you deem it necessary adjust the commit message appropriately.
