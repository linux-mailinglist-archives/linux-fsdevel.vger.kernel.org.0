Sorry, I don't see relevance b/w km rings and what Christoph wants.
I explained why in some sub-thread, but maybe someone can tell
what I'm missing.

Yep, it could be, potentially, it's just the patchset doesn't plumb
it to other requests and uses it within fuse. It's just cases like
that always make me wonder, here it was why what is basically an
internal kernel fuse API is exposed as an io_uring uapi. Maybe there
was a discussion about it I missed?

That would avoid doing a large revamp of uapi and plumbing it
to each every request type when there is already a uapi that does
what you want, does it well and have lots of things figured out.
Keeping the I/O path sane is important, io_uring already has 3
different ways of passing buffers, let's not add a 4th one
unless it achieves something meaningful.

Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear. With what I see you're trying to do,
i.e. copying client's data into user space (server), I think
registered buffers would be a better abstraction. However, I just
went with your design on top of regions, since it's not the first
iteration of the series and I wasn't following previous ones, and
IIRC you was already using registered buffers in previous revisions
but moved from that for some reason. IOW, I was taking you main I/O
path and was trying to make the setup path a bit more flexible and
reusable.

There is a high bar for adding a new interface for passing buffers
that needs to be propagated to a good number of request handlers,
and there is already one that gives you all you need to write
efficient user space.

It's up to the user (i.e. fuse server) to either use OP_READ/etc. using
user addresses that you have in your design from mmap()ing regions, or
registering it and using OP_READ_FIXED.
