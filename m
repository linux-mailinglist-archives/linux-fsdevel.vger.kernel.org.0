It's not really useless, it works as it's designed ;-)

As Dietmar highlighted, you need to pick a higher boost value that gives you
the best perf/watt for your use case.

I assume that this is a patch in your own Android 5.4 kernel, right? I'm not
aware of any such patch in Android Common Kernel. If it's there, do you mind
pointing me to the gerrit change that introduced it?

Do you have a specific workload in mind here that is failing? It would help if
you can explain in detail the mode of failure you're seeing to help us
understand the problem better.

If a task util was 200, how long does it take for it to reach 280? Why do you
need to have this immediate boost value applied and can't wait for this time to
lapse? I'm not sure, but ramping up by 80 points shouldn't take *that* long,
but don't quote me on this :-)

I assume {uclamp_min, uclamp_max} = {145, 1024} is not good enough because you
want this 200 task to be boosted to 280. One can argue that not all tasks at
200 need to be boosted to 280 too. So the question is, like above, what type
of tasks that are failing here and how do you observe this failure? It seems
there's a class of performance critical tasks that need this fast boosting.
Can't you identify them and boost them individually?

There's nothing that prevents you to change the uclamp_min of the cgroup
dynamically by the way. Like for instance when an app launches you can choose
a high boost value then lower it once it started up. Or if you know the top-app
is a game and you want to guarantee a good minimum performance for it; you
can choose to increase the top-app uclamp_min value too in a special gaming
mode or something.

For best perf/watt, using the per-task API is the best way forward. But
I understand it'll take time for apps/android framework to learn how to use the
per-task API most effectively. But it is what we should be aiming for.
