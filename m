Ignoring attribute which affects fs operations for network filesystems
is a problem. And read-only attribute is such example. If Linux network
fs drivers are going to ignore them, then "rm -f" would not work for
files with read-only attribute set.

But attributes which does not affect fs operations like, "system",
"hidden", "archived", "offline", ... and whatever else is used, should
be ignored at all (well, what else such attributes could do if they do
not affect anything?).

I mostly agree.

Just OFFLINE is not a permission which grants some access, right? So it
should not be in ACL at all, which controls and grants/deny access.

For me it sounds like a good idea to export these attributes as xattrs
in system namespace.

Another "big" consumer of them can be wine.
