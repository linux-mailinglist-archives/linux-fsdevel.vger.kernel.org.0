[add fsdevel to cc because why not?]

So I guess the rest of the thread is here?

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAF+WW=oKQak6ktiOH75pHSDe7YEkYD-1ditgcsWB=z+aRKJogQ@mail.gmail.com/

Which in turn is discussing the change made here?

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20180511192651.21324-2-mfasheh@suse.de/

Based on the stated intent in the original patch ("process can write
inode") I do not think Mr. Valtier's patch is correct.
inode_permission(..., MAY_WRITE) returns 0 if the caller can access the
file in the given mode, or some negative errno if it cannot.  I don't
know why he sees the behavior he describes:

"I've tested that I can create an other readonly file as root and have
my unprivileged user deduplicate it however if I then make the file
other writeable I cannot anymore*."

Which test exactly is the one that results in a denial?  I don't think I
can reproduce this:

$ ls /opt/a /opt/b
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 65536 May  7 15:09 /opt/a
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 65536 May  7 15:09 /opt/b
$ xfs_io -r -c 'dedupe /opt/b 4096 4096 4096' /opt/a
XFS_IOC_FILE_EXTENT_SAME: Operation not permitted

...and yes, the unusual permissions behavior of FIDEDUPERANGE should be
better tested.
