Less user friendly is an understatement.

Obscure errors that only get reported via overloaded standard error
codes is a massive problem today, for _developers_ - have you never had
a day of swearing over trying to track down where in a massive subsystem
an -EINVAL is coming from?

It's even worse for end users that don't know to check the dmesg log.

And I support my code, so these would turn into bug reports coming
across my desk - no thanks; I already get enough weird shit from other
subsystems that I have to look at and at least triage.

Today, you cannot user docker and casefolding on _different parts of_
the same filesystem.

So yees, today users do have to partition by application, or only use
one feature or the other.

This isn't about allowing casefolding and overlayfs to fix on the same
subtree, that would be a bigger project.

I honestly don't know what you're claiming here.
