Thanks for the patch. Can you please make sure to Cc the following
people who attended the dedicated shiftfs session together with you at
LPC in Lisbon for v2? They're all major stackholders in this:

St√©phane Graber <stgraber@ubuntu.com>
Eric Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Aleksa Sarai <cyphar@cyphar.com>
Christian Brauner <christian.brauner@ubuntu.com>

(I haven't gotten around to looking at the initial bind mount patchset
you sent out about two weeks ago. Pre-holidays it's always tricky to
find time for proper reviews...)

Christian
