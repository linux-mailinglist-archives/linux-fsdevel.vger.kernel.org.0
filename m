Yes, something like that I suppose.

I think tweaking min_pause is a wrong way to do this. I think that is just a
symptom. Can you run something like:

while true; do
	cat /sys/kernel/debug/bdi/<fuse-bdi>/stats
	echo "---------"
	sleep 1
done >bdi-debug.txt

while you are writing to the FUSE filesystem and share the output file?
That should tell us a bit more about what's happening inside the writeback
throttling. Also do you somehow configure min/max_ratio for the FUSE bdi?
You can check in /sys/block/<fuse-bdi>/bdi/{min,max}_ratio . I suspect the
problem is that the BDI dirty limit does not ramp up properly when we
increase dirtied pages in large chunks.

Actually, there's a patch queued in mm tree that improves the ramping up of
bdi dirty limit for strictlimit bdis [1]. It would be nice if you could
test whether it changes something in the behavior you observe. Thanks!
