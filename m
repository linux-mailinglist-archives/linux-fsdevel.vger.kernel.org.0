That's just for the accounting, it's the:

ctx->creds = get_current_cred();

The API would be the exact same, there would just be some way to
associate rings when you create them. Probably a new field in struct
io_uring_params (and an associated flag), which would tell io_uring that
two separate rings are really the same "user". This would allow io_uring
to use the same io-wq workqueues, for example, etc.

This depends on the fact that you can setup the rings with the right
personalities, that they would be known upfront. From your description,
I'm not so sure that's the case? If not, then we would indeed need
something that can pass in the credentials on a per-command basis. Not
sure what that would look like.
