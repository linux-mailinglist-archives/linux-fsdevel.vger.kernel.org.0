Exactly what you've commented below. Input on whether any of these
changes would be either problematic if you e.g. were to implement
openat() on top of openat2() in the future or if it would be problematic
if we e.g. were to really deprecate AT_* flags for new syscalls.

Fair, but I expect that e.g. a C library would simply implement openat()
on top of openat2() if the latter is available and thus could simply
pass RESOLVE_SYMLINKS so any new I/O library not making use of the
syscall directly would simply get the old behavior. For anyone using the
syscall directly they need to know about its exact semantics anyway. But
again, maybe just having it opt-in is fine.

So this is partially why I think it's at least worth considerings: the
new RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS flag does block all symlink resolution, not just
for the last component in contrast to AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW. This is
