Right, but those syscalls are what instigate io_uring operations, so
whatever process starts that operation, or gets handed that handle
should be tracked with auid and sessionid (the two work together to
track) unless we can easily track io_uring ops to connect them to a
previous setup syscall.  If we see a need to keep the auid, then the
sessionid goes with it.

I wouldn't call them confusion but rather parallels, attributing a
particular subject to an action.
