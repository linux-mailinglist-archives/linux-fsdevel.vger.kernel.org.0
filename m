Ok, thanks for the explanation!

Looking at this patch from David Howells :
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/909202.1675959337@warthog.procyon.org.uk/
indicates that we don't have that problem with O_DIRECT as it operates
on dedicated pages (not part of the shared page cache). And these pages
might be filled via DMA (depending on the filesystem and block device).

Is my understanding correct?

Together with this patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20230209102954.528942-4-dhowells@redhat.com/

I guess it would be easy to pass a flag (maybe SPLICE_F_FORCE_COPY)
down to generic_file_splice_read() and let it create dedicated pages
and use memcpy() from the page cache to the dedicated pages.
This would mean one memcpy(), but it would allow the pipe to be used
for the splice() to the socket, tee(). This might be easier than
using pread() followed by vmsplice(SPLICE_F_GIFT).

The usage of SPLICE_F_GIFT is very confusing to me...
I found this example in libkcapi using the kernel crypto sockets:
https://github.com/smuellerDD/libkcapi/blob/master/lib/kcapi-kernel-if.c#L324
where it just passes SPLICE_F_GIFT together with an iovec passed from the
caller of the library.

To me it's not clear if the caller can still use it's buffers referenced by
the passed iovec...
