Note that systemd caps all services/processes it starts to 500k fds by
default. So someone would have to hand-massage the per process limit
like in your example.

And fwiw, allocating file descriptors above INT_MAX is inherently unsafe
because we have stuff like:

#define AT_FDWCD -100

If we allow file descriptor allocation above INT_MAX it's easy to
allocate a file descriptor at 4294967196 which is AT_FDCWD. If you pass
that to fchmodat() or something similar you have a problem because
instead of changing whatever the file descriptor points to you're
changing your current working directory.

Since we have a bunch of system calls that return file descriptors such
as pidfd_open() returning above INT_MAX would mean we'd return errnos as
valid fds, e.g., ENETDOWN for an AT_FDCWD range allocation.

But what's annoying is that we are communicating very confusing things
to userspace by being inconsistent in our system call interface.

We have system calls that accept int as the file descriptor type
(fallocate() faccessat() fchmodat() etc) and then we have system calls
that accept unsigned int as the file descriptor type (close()
ftruncate() fchdir() fchmod() etc).

What makes it all worse is that glibc enforces that all fd-based system
calls take int as an argument:

close(2)                              System Calls Manual                              close(2)

NAME
       close - close a file descriptor

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int close(int fd);

So we now also have a userspace-kernel disconnect.

Yeah, I tend to agree.

I think Mateusz' idea of exposing the maximum supported value in procfs
as a read-only file is probably pretty sensible. Userspace like systemd
has to do stuff like if you want to allow large number of fds by
default:

#if BUMP_PROC_SYS_FS_NR_OPEN
        int v = INT_MAX;

        /* Argh! The kernel enforces maximum and minimum values on the fs.nr_open, but we don't really know
         * what they are. The expression by which the maximum is determined is dependent on the architecture,
         * and is something we don't really want to copy to userspace, as it is dependent on implementation
         * details of the kernel. Since the kernel doesn't expose the maximum value to us, we can only try
         * and hope. Hence, let's start with INT_MAX, and then keep halving the value until we find one that
         * works. Ugly? Yes, absolutely, but kernel APIs are kernel APIs, so what do can we do... ðŸ¤¯ */

        for (;;) {
                int k;

                v &= ~(__SIZEOF_POINTER__ - 1); /* Round down to next multiple of the pointer size */
                if (v < 1024) {
                        log_warning("Can't bump fs.nr_open, value too small.");
                        break;
                }

                k = read_nr_open();
                if (k < 0) {
                        log_error_errno(k, "Failed to read fs.nr_open: %m");
                        break;
                }
                if (k >= v) { /* Already larger */
                        log_debug("Skipping bump, value is already larger.");
                        break;
                }

                r = sysctl_writef("fs/nr_open", "%i", v);
                if (r == -EINVAL) {
                        log_debug("Couldn't write fs.nr_open as %i, halving it.", v);
                        v /= 2;
                        continue;
                }
                if (r < 0) {
                        log_full_errno(IN_SET(r, -EROFS, -EPERM, -EACCES) ? LOG_DEBUG : LOG_WARNING, r, "Failed to bump fs.nr_open, ignoring: %m");
                        break;
                }

                log_debug("Successfully bumped fs.nr_open to %i", v);
                break;
