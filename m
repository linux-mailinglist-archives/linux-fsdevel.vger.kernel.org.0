I'm afraid I don't see any such iterator readily available in the common
code, so that would also have to be per fs as far as I can see :/

Also some filesystems just don't have a next_entry iterator readily
available; for example on 9p the network protocol is pretty much exactly
like getdents and a readdir call is issued continuously until either
filldir64 returns an error (e.g. buffer full) or the server returned 0
(or an error); if you leave the v9fs_dir_readdir{,_dotl}() call you
loose this information immediately.
Getting this information out would be doubly appreciable because the
"final getdents" to confirm the dir has been fully read is redundant
with that previous last 9p readdir which ended the previous iteration
(could also be fixed by caching...), but that'll really require fixing
up the iterate_shared() operation to signal such a thing...

Yes, if there's an easy way forward I overlooked I'd be happy to spend a
bit more time on it; and discussing never hurts.
In for a penny, in for a pound :)
