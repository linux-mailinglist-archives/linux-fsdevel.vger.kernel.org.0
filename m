Hi, Axel,

Thanks.  The 2nd patch definitely needs some fixup on some functions
(either I overlooked without enough CONFIG_* chosen; I am surprised I have
vhost even compiled out when testing..), hope that won't bring you too much
trouble.  I'll send a fixup soon on top of patch 2.

Yes.  If the test to carry out only uses 1 thread, it shouldn't bring much
difference.

For myself I don't yet have an application that can leverage this much
indeed, because QEMU so far only uses 1 reader thread.

IIRC Anish was exactly proposing some kvm specific solutions to make single
uffd scale, and this might be suitable for any use case like that where we
may want to use single uffd and try to make it scale with threads.  Using 1
reader + N worker is also a solution, but when using N readers (which also
do the work) the app will hit this problem.

I am also aware that some apps use more than 1 reader threads (umap), but I
don't really know more than that.

The problem is I think we shouldn't have that overhead easily just because
an app invokes >1 readers, meanwhile it also doesn't make much sense to
wake up all readers for a single event for userfaults.  So it should always
be something good to have.

Thanks,
