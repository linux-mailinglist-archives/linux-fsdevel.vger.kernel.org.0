Granted, an over-generalization but non in any way different from
claiming that currently on one needs to know about btrfs subvolumes or
that the proposed vfsmount solution will make it magically so that no
one needs to care anymore.

Tools will have to change either way is my point. And a lot of tools do
already handle subvolumes specially exactly because of the non-unique
inode situation. And if they don't they still can get confused by seing
st_dev numbers they can't associate with a filesystem.

3.229 Mount Point
Either the system root directory or a directory for which the st_dev
field of structure stat differs from that of its parent directory.

I think that's just an argument against mapping subvolumes to vfsmounts.
Because bind-mounts don't change the device number - and they very much
shouldn't.

The thing is I'm not even sure there's anything to fix.

This discussion started with btrfs maybe getting an alternative way to
uniquify an inode independent of st_dev.

I'm not sure that is such a massive problem.

If we give both btrfs and bcachefs a single flag in statx() that allows
_interested_ userspace to query whether a file is located on a subvolume
that shouldn't be a problem (We have STATX_ATTR_* which identifies
additional properties that are restricted to few filesytems).

And all the specific gobbledigook can be implemented as an ioctl() -
ideally both btrfs and bcachefs agree on something - that the vfs
doesn't have to care about at all.

I genuinely don't care if they report a fake st_dev from stat(). I
genuinely _do_ care that we don't make vfsmounts privy to this.

Let alone that automounts are a giant paint. Not just do they iirc allow
to create shadow mounts, they also interact with namespace and container
creation.

If you spawn thousands of containers each with a private mount namespace
- which is the default - you now trigger automounts in thousands of
containers when triggering a lookup on btrfs. If you have mount
propagation turned on each automount may also propagate into god knows
how many other mount namespaces. That's just nasty.

IOW, making subvolumes vfsmounts will also have wider semantic
implications for using btrfs as a filesystem.
