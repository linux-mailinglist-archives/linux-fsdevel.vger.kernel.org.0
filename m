Actually I think it is fine to use the pipe buffer flags separately,
if MAY_READ/MAY_WRITE is set in source end, the sink side need to respect
it. All current in-tree source end actually implies both MAY_READ & MAY_WRITE.

Yeah, it is actually transferring the buffer ownership, and looks
SPLICE_F_GIFT is exactly the case, but the driver side needs to set
QUEUE_FLAG_STABLE_WRITES for avoiding writeback to touch these pages.

Follows the idea:

file(devices(such as, fuse, ublk), produce pipe buffer) -> direct pipe -> file(consume the pipe buffer)

The 'consume' could be READ or WRITE.

So once SPLICE_F_GIFT is set from source side, the two buffer flags
aren't needed any more, right?

Please see the detailed explanation & use case in following link:
