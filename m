Thanks for your reviewï¼Œthe underlying filesystem is ext4, 
ext4_alloc_inode doesn't

allocate a new vfs inode from slab, and I found the "new inode" was used 
by another

thread in vmcore, in other words, the new inode should be a new one , 
but not.

Maybe it's not a filesystem problem, and fixing this problem in 
iget_locked is not

a good way, I 'll try to find the root cause and fix it.
