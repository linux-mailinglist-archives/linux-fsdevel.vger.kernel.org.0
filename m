Perhaps. I haven't looked at the code yet. But I like the idea of
protecting the file from any access from the user-space, as it is
implemented for swapfile.

There is definitely no task to create a difference storage file on the
same block device for which the snapshot is being created. The file can
be created on any block device.

Still, the variant when a whole partition is allocated for the difference
storage can also be useful.

I'll be glad.
