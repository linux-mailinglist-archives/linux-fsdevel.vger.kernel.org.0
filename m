I'm all for flexibility here.

We're going to have 2 classes of applications interacting with HSM backed
storage, normal applications and applications that know they're backed by HSM.
The normal applications are just going to crash if they get an error on read(2),
it doesn't matter what errno it is.  The second class would have different
things they'd want to do in the face of different errors, and that's what this
patchset is targeting.  We can limit it to a few errno's if that makes you feel
better, but having more than just one would be helpful.  Thanks,

Josef
