It's set for any regular file and directory.

No, it really isn't. fdget() doesn't take f_pos_lock at all:

fdget()
-> __fdget()
   -> __fget_light()
      -> __fget()
         -> __fget_files()
            -> __fget_files_rcu()

If that were true then any system call that passes an fd and uses
fdget() would try to acquire a mutex on f_pos_lock. We'd be serializing
every *at based system call on f_pos_lock whenever we have multiple fds
referring to the same file trying to operate on it concurrently.

We do have fdget_pos() and fdput_pos() as a special purpose fdget() for
a select group of system calls that require this synchronization.

I don't follow. Also this is hacky so no.

The reason why io_uring *at implementations don't work with fixed files
is that the VFS interface expect regular fds. You could very well make
this work for fixed files but why. It would mean exposing a whole new
set of vfs helpers to io_uring and would probably involve nasty corner
cases.

Also the connection between regular and fixed files in io_uring is
pretty much fluent. While fixed files can only remain pinned in an
io_uring instance it requires that the caller explicitly gave up all
references in their fdtable to that struct file by closing all fds
referring to the same file.

But there's no guarantee. For example, if another thread dups the fd or
the caller sends the fd via SCM_RIGHTS to another process or the caller
simply doesn't close the fd or another thread gets an fd to the same
file from that task via pidfd_getfd before it closed it this doesn't hold.

So it's very well possible to have an fd and a fixed io_uring reference
referring to the same file. The first one can be used with the regular
system call interface and io_uring *at requests that forbid fixed files.
And the other one can be used for i_uring fixed file operations. Doesn't
matter if that shouldn't be done, it's possible afaict.

For regular and fixed files you also have the same problem from within
the same io_uring instance where you can have concurrent getdent
requests. You'd end up producing the exact same inconsistencies.

It doesn't help.
