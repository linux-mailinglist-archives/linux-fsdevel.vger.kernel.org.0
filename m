So I'm happy to drop the exportfs preliminary we have now preventing
kernfs from being exported but then Christoph and you should figure out
what the security implications of allowing kernfs instances to be
exported areare because I'm not an NFS export expert.

Filesystems that fall under kernfs that are exportable by NFS as I
currently understand it are at least:

(1) sysfs
(2) cgroupfs

Has anyone ever actually tried to export the two and tested what
happens? Because I wouldn't be surprised if this ended in tears but
maybe I'm overly pessimistic.

Both (1) and (2) are rather special and don't have standard filesystem
semantics in a few places.

- cgroupfs isn't actually namespace aware. Whereas most filesystems like
  tmpfs and ramfs that are mountable inside unprivileged containers are
  multi-instance filesystems, aka allocate a new superblock per
  container cgroupfs is single-instance with a nasty implementation to
  virtualize the per-container view via cgroup namespaces. I wouldn't be
  surprised if that ends up being problematic.

- Cgroupfs has write-time permission checks as the process that is moved
  into a cgroup isn't known at open time. That has been exploitable
  before this was fixed.

- Even though it's legacy cgroup has a v1 and v2 mode where v1 is even
  more messed up than v2 including the release-agent logic which ends up
  issuing a usermode helper to call a binary when a cgroup is released.

- sysfs potentially exposes all kinds of extremly low-level information
  to a remote machine.

None of this gives me the warm and fuzzy. But that's just me.

Otherwise, I don't understand what it means that a userspace NFS server
can export kernfs instances. I don't know what that means and what the
contrast to in-kernel NFS server export is and whether that has the same
security implications. If so it's even scary that some random userspace
NFS server can just expose guts like kernfs.

But if both of you feel that this is safe to do and there aren't any
security issues lurking that have gone unnoticed simply because no one
has really ever exported sysfs or cgroupfs then by all means continue
allowing that. I'm rather skeptical.
