The ops can be queued together and submitted together.  Two separate
(but possibly linked) ops should result in exactly the same number of
syscalls as a single combined op.

The original idea was to use the cloned /dev/fuse fd to sort requests
into separate queues.  That was only half finished: the input queue is
currently shared by all clones, but once a request is read by the
server from a particular clone it is put into a separate processing
queue.   Adding separate input queues to each clone should also be
possible.

I'm not saying this is definitely the direction we should be taking,
but it's something to consider.

That function name indicates that this is too complex: it is doing two
independent things (ending one request and fetching the next).

Fine if it's a valid optimization, but I'm saying that it likely isn't.

If the filesystem is providing the result of a READ request as a
pointer to a buffer (which can be the case with fuse_reply_data()),
then that buffer will need to be copied to the shared buffer, and from
the shared buffer to the read destination.

That first copy is unnecessary if the kernel receives the pointer to
the userspace buffer and copies the data directly to the destination.

I'm just looking for answers why this architecture is the best.  Maybe
it is, but I find it too complex and can't explain why it's going to
perform better than a much simpler single ring model.

That's just my gut feeling.   fuse/dev_uring.c is 1233 in this RFC.
And that's just the queuing.

I'm in favor of using io_uring, if possible.

I'm also in favor of a single shared buffer (ring) if possible.  Using
cloned fd + plain READV / WRITEV ops is one possibility.

But I'm not opposed to IORING_OP_URING_CMD either.   Btw, fuse reply
could be inlined in the majority of cases into that 80 byte free space
in the sqe.  Also might consider an extended cqe mode, where short
fuse request could be inlined as well (e.g. IORING_SETUP_CQE128 -> 112
byte payload).

Probably, I don't remember anymore.
