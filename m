Yes, there's only a few of patches be reviewed this week, due to most of
related people are in LSF meeting :)

Understand, I did tend to merge your change soon, due to it changes the
fundament of whole idmapped test, but I can't refused other people's
patches if they're ready. One of you or XuYang has to do once rebase at
least, so I have to comply with the sequence of patch reviewed.

If you'd like to merge your patch next week, I'll notice others wait one
more week in the [ANNOUNCE] of this week, if they want to write idmapped
related patches. Is that good to you? Please try to give your patch enough
test, make sure it won't bring in big regression, then we can merge it
quickly and smoothly :)

Thanks,
Zorro
