This code could use some serious cleanup as it is super hard to follow
right now imho. It often gives the impression of forming loops when
following callchains down into the filesystem. None of this is by
design of course. I just happened to grow that way, I guess.
However, for maintenance this is quite painful. I also don't like that
the relationship between xattr and acls and the .set_acl inode methods
is rather opaque in the code. I have a vague plan to cleanup some of
that since I had to mess with this code not too long ago.
But that'll be a bigger chunk of work.
