Yes, and if there is a writer (to any VMA, not just to the VMA we're
working on), this page fault has to wait for that writer.  Rather than
just waiting for this I/O to complete.

I really doubt any process has only a single VMA.  Usually, there's at
least stack, program text, program data, program rodata, heap, vdso,
libc text, libc data, libc rodata, etc.

$ cat /proc/self/maps |wc -l
23

That's 5 for the program, 5 for ld.so, 5 for libc, heap, stack, vvar,
vdso, and a few I can't identify.

Also, if our program only has one anon VMA, what is it doing that
it needs to modify the tree?  Growing it, perhaps?  Almost anything
else would cause it to have more than one VMA ;-)

But let's consider the case where we have a 1TB VMA which is servicing the
majority of faults and we try to mprotect one page in it.  The mprotect()
thread will take the mmap_lock for write, then block on the VMA lock until
all the other threads taking page faults have finished (ie waiting for all
the swapin to happen).  While it waits, new faults on that VMA will also
block (on the mmap_lock as the read_trylock on the VMA lock will fail).
So yes, this case is just as bad as the original problem.

We have two alternatives here.  We can do what we do today -- fall back
to taking the mmap_lock for read before dropping it while we wait
for the folio lock.  Or we can do something like this ...

                else

... and then figure out a return value that lets the caller of
handle_mm_fault() know not to call vma_end_read().

Or we can decide that it's OK to reintroduce this worst-case scenario,
because we've now reduced the likelihood of it happening so far.
