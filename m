Ah, now I understand.  I think you're being a little too specific by
calling this zone-append.  This is really a "write-anywhere" operation,
and the specified address is only a hint.

Urgh, no, that's dreadful.  I'm not familiar with the io_uring code.
Maybe the first 8 bytes of the user_data could be required to be the
result offset for this submission type?

But we also have O_APPEND files.  And maybe we'll have other kinds of file
in future for which this would make sense.

... I disagree that it doesn't fit into POSIX.  As I said above, O_APPEND
is a POSIX concept, so POSIX already understands that writes may not end
up at the current write pointer.
