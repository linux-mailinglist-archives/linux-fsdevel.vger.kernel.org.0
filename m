BTW, there's another piece of brittleness that almost accidentally doesn't
end up biting us - nd->depth should be cleared in set_nameidata(), not
in path_init().  In this case we are saved by the fact that the only
really early failure in path_init() can't happen on the first call,
so if we do leave the sucker before zeroing nd->depth, we are saved by
the fact that terminate_walk() has just been called and it *does*
clear nd->depth.  It's obviously cleaner to have it initialized from
the very beginning and not bother with it in path_init() at all.
Separate patch, though - this is not, strictly speaking, a bug.
