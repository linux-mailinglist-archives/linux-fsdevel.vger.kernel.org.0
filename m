Dear Friend,

How are you doing? I guess that you are fine and healthy. This is to inform
you that I have concluded the transaction successfully. It has been a long
time since our last communication. It was unfortunate that your partnership
with me failed to complete the fund=E2=80=99s transfer. I guess it got to a=
 time
when there was so much pressure and confusion that you became less
interested about the transaction.


In any case, I=E2=80=99m happy to inform you about my success in getting th=
e fund
transferred under the co-operation of the new partner. I=E2=80=99m presentl=
y in
Venezuela on investment .However; i didn't forget your past effort and
attempts to assist me in transferring the fund despite the fact that we
couldn't reach a specific conclusion.

In appreciation of your attempt to assist, I and my new partner reached a
decision that you deserve to be compensated, this letter is therefore to
inform you that I left a compensation of $350,000.00 in your name so that
you will share the joy with me. I advise you to contact BTCI bank for the
transfer of the $350,000.00. To avoid a long delay of the compensation fund
transfer, I instructed BTCI bank to issue an international ATM visa card
and send it to your home address via courier delivery Company.

The bank contact information is stated below:

Bank Name: BTCI Bank
Email Address: btcbanktg478@gmail.com
Address: 169, Boulevard du 13 janvier BP 363 Lom=C3=A9, Togo
Contact person: Mr. Leonard Mathias

Inform me as soon as you receive the ATM visa card from BTCI bank. I wish
you success in all your endeavors.

Best Regards
Barrister   uchenna ilobi
