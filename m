Sorry, coming back to this now. I lost sight of this patch.

chown_common() and chmod_common() are very close to the syscall boundary
so it's very unlikely that we run into weird issues apart from userspace
regression when they suddenly fail a change for new unexpected reasons.

But just look at default_llseek():

    > git grep default_llseek | wc -l
    461

That is a lot of stuff and it's not immediately clear how deeply or
nested they are called. For example from overlayfs in stacked
callchains. Who knows what strange assumptions some of the callers have
including the possible return values from that helper.

This is difficult to answer. Yes, on the face of it it seems useful to
be able to kill various operations that sleep on inode lock but who
knows what implicit guarantees/expectations we're going to break if we
do it. Maybe @Jan has some thoughts here as well.
