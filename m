Not for the kernel, no.  Just the contributions to fstests.

For example, if I were sending a patch deluge, the online fsck testing
patches would be cc'd to you; to whomever's listed as M: under XFS in
fstests MAINTAINERS; and fstests@ and linux-xfs@.

The kernel patches would be cc'd to linux-xfs, and to whomever steps up
to review the code (who are we kidding, dchinner).

xfsprogs patches for online fsck would be cc'd to linux-xfs and Carlos.

I disagree -- yes, /developers/ (and the release manager) should be
running tests and reporting those results to that fs project.

However, I defined the testing lead (quoting from above):

"**Testing Lead**: This person is responsible for setting the test
coverage goals of the project, negotiating with developers to decide
on new tests for new features, and making sure that developers and
release managers execute on the testing."

In my mind, that means the testing lead should be reviewing changes
proposed for tests/xfs/* in fstests by XFS developers to make sure that
new features are adequately covered; and checking that drive-by
contributions from others fit well with what's already there.

(That's what I thought you wanted out from the people mentioned in the
fstests MAINTAINERS file...)

...so the testing lead would be the person who you'd talk to directly
about changes that you want to make.

(Wait, who is "I" here?  You, Zorro?  Or were you paraphrasing a
developer?)
