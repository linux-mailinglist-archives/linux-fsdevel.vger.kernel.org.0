Well, now you are speaking of FAN_REPORT_FID mode. There I agree we
currently support only filesystems with a sane behavior. But there are
definitely existing users of fanotify in "standard" file-descriptor mode
for filesystems such as sysfs, proc, etc. So the new flag would have to
change behavior only to FAN_REPORT_FID groups and that's why I think it's a
bit odd.

Yeah, overall I agree it would be nice to differentiate filesystems where
we aren't going to generate all the events. But as I write above, there are
already existing users for non-FID mode so we cannot have that flag in the
general setting.

Yup.

Yes. I'm sorry I didn't describe all the details. My idea was to report
even on a dentry with the fsid statfs(2) would return on it. We don't want
to call dentry_statfs() on each event (it's costly and we don't always have
the dentry available) but we can have a special callback into the
filesystem to get us just the fsid (which is very cheap) and call *that* on
the inode on which the event happens to get fsid for the event. So yes, the
sb mark would be returning events with different fsids for btrfs. Or we
could compare the obtained fsid with the one in the root volume and ignore
the event if they mismatch (that would be more like the different subvolume
=> different filesystem point of view and would require some more work on
fanotify side to remember fsid in the sb mark and not in the sb connector).

Yes, inode marks definitely don't have the problem so enabling them is a
no-brainer.
