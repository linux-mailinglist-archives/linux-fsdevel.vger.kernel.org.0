Correct. Another point is that Landlock uses the file's path (i.e.
dentry + mnt) to walk down to the parent.  Only using the dentry would
be incorrect for most use cases (i.e. any system with more than one
mount point).

Something to keep in mind is that relying on xattr to label files
requires to deny sanboxed processes to change this xattr, otherwise it
would be trivial to bypass such a sandbox.  Sandboxing must be though as
a whole and Landlock's design for file system access control takes into
account all kind of file system operations that could bypass a sandbox
policy (e.g. mount operations), and also protects from impersonations.

What is the use case for this patch series?  Couldn't Landlock be used
for that?
