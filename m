Fair enough.

Darrick, I suppose just one thing then, using M for Testing Lead seems
likely to implicate the 'Testing Lead' getting Cc'd on every single new
patch. As much as I could help review, I don't think I can commit to
that, and I think that's the point of the current split. To let us split
roles to help scale stuff.

So how about a separate new prefix, TL: ? Adding Linus in case he has
a stronger preference to only keep us at one character fist index on
MAINTAINERS.
