Seems to work for me, just needed to adjust the -EAGAIN test case in
liburing.

I forgot to mention, but this will still stall the submission sequence.
Before, if you wanted to queue 8 sqes and we had an error on the 5th, we'd
return ret == 4 and the application would have to look at the sqring to
figure out what is wrong with the head entry. Now we'd return 5, and
have a cqe posted for the 5th entry that had an error. The app can then
decide if it needs to do anything about this. If it doesn't, it just
needs to call io_uring_enter() again to submit the remaining 3 entries.

I do like this change. Any error on an sqe will result in a cqe being
posted, instead of having the submission be slightly different and have
the cqe be dependent on where the error occurred.
