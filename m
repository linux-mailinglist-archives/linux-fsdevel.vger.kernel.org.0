The kernels I'm testing with don't have any debug options enabled,
outside of the basic cheap stuff. I do notice you have all btrfs debug
stuff enabled, I'll try and do that too.

I've run this on kvm on an apple m1 max, no luck there. Ran it on a
7950X, no luck there. Fiddling config options on the 7950 and booting up
the 7763 two socket box. Both that and the 7950 are using gen4 optane,
should be plenty beefy. But if it's timing related, well...

If I can't reproduce this, then this seems like the best way forward
indeed.
