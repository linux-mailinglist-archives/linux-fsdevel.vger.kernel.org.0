Which is likely to give wrong results and I agree with you that it
should rely on vfs_getattr_nosec().

We should cool it with the quick hacks to fix things. :)

So, I think we want both; we want the ovl_copyattr() and the
vfs_getattr_nosec() change:

(1) overlayfs should copy up the inode version in ovl_copyattr(). That
    is in line what we do with all other inode attributes. IOW, the
    overlayfs inode's i_version counter should aim to mirror the
    relevant layer's i_version counter. I wouldn't know why that
    shouldn't be the case. Asking the other way around there doesn't
    seem to be any use for overlayfs inodes to have an i_version that
    isn't just mirroring the relevant layer's i_version.
(2) Jeff's changes for ima to make it rely on vfs_getattr_nosec().
    Currently, ima assumes that it will get the correct i_version from
    an inode but that just doesn't hold for stacking filesystem.

While (1) would likely just fix the immediate bug (2) is correct and
_robust_. If we change how attributes are handled vfs_*() helpers will
get updated and ima with it. Poking at raw inodes without using
appropriate helpers is much more likely to get ima into trouble.
