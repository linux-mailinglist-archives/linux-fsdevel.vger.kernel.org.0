So there is generally another refcount, because dma_buf is just the
cross-driver interface to some kind of real underlying buffer object from
the various graphics related subsystems we have.

And since it's a pure file based api thing that ceases to serve any
function once the fd/file is gone we tied all the dma_buf refcounting to
the refcount struct file already maintains. But the underlying buffer
object can easily outlive the dma_buf, and over the lifetime of an
underlying buffer object you might actually end up creating different
dma_buf api wrappers for it (but at least in drm we guarantee there's at
most one, hence why vmwgfx does the atomic_inc_unless_zero trick, which I
don't particularly like and isn't really needed).

But we could add another refcount, it just means we have 3 of those then
when only really 2 are needed.

Also maybe here two: dma_fence are bounded like other disk i/o (including
the option of timeouts if things go very wrong), so it's very much not
forever but at most a few seconds worst case (shit hw/driver excluded, as
usual).
