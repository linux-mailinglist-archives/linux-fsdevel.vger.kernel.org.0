Wait - didn't we already fix this for mtime updates on IOCB_NOWAIT
modification operations? Yeah, we did:

kiocb_modified(iocb)
  file_modified_flags(iocb->ki_file, iocb->ki_flags)
    ....
    ret = inode_needs_update_time()
    if (ret <= 0)
	return ret;
    if (flags & IOCB_NOWAIT)
	return -EAGAIN;
    <does timestamp update>

Yeah, so this needs the same treatment as file_modified_flags() -
touch_atime() needs a flag variant that passes IOCB_NOWAIT, and
after atime_needs_update() returns trues we should check IOCB_NOWAIT
and return EAGAIN if it is set. That will punt the operation that
needs to the update to a worker thread that can block....

Yup, that's the sort of thing that needs to be done.

But as I said in the "llseek for io-uring" thread, we need to stop
the game of whack-a-mole passing random nowait boolean flags to VFS
operations before it starts in earnest.  We really need a common
context structure (like we have a kiocb for IO operations) that
holds per operation control state so we have consistency across all
the operations that we need different behaviours for.

Writes don't update atime - they update mtime, and there are other
considerations for doing the mtime update before the data
modification. e.g. we have to strip permissions from the inode prior
to any changes that are going to be made, so we've already got to do
all the "change inode metadata" checks and modifications before the
data is written anyway....

Cheers,

Dave.
