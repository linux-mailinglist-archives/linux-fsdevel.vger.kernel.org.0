My main concern was overhead, since the whole goal of io_uring is speed.

The chances that audit does use this functionality in the future suggest
to me that it is best to leave this check in.

No, I think you have a good understanding of it.  I'm asking hard
questions to avoid missing something important.  If we can reuse the
syscall infrastructure for this then that is extremely helpful (if not
lazy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing).  It does mean that the
io_uring op dictionary will need to live in userspace audit the way it
is currently implemented, or provide a flag to indicate it is a syscall
number to be translated in the kernel either at the time of rule
addition or translated on the fly on rule check in the kernel adding
overhead to a critical path.

Ok, I don't see a pressing need to add it initially, but should add a
check to block that field from being used to avoid the confusion of
unpredictable behaviour should someone try to add a perm filter to a
io_uring filter.  That should be done protectively in the kernel and
proactively in userspace.

Agreed.

I've added a perm filter block as an additional patch in userspace and
updated the tree so that first commit is no longer the top of tree but
the branch name is current.

I'll add a kernel perm filter check.

I just noticed some list checking that is missing in tree and watch in
your patch.

I think they can be seperate rules for now.  Either a syscall rule
catching all io_uring ops can be added, or an io_uring rule can be added
to catch specific ops.  The scenario I was thinking of was catching
syscalls of specific io_uring ops.

I wasn't expecting you to work the weekend.  :-)

Standard RFC disclaimers apply.
