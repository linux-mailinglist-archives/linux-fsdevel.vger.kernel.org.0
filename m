Cleaned it up a bit, and added registered buffer support as well (which
is another variant over non-vectored reads) and queued IO support as
well:

https://git.kernel.dk/cgit/liburing/commit/?id=6ab387dab745aff2af760d9fed56a4154669edec

and it's now part of the regular testing. Here's my usual run:

Running test file-verify                                            3 sec
Running test file-verify /dev/nvme0n1p2                             3 sec
Running test file-verify /dev/nvme1n1p1                             3 sec
Running test file-verify /dev/sdc2                                  Test file-verify timed out (may not be a failure)
Running test file-verify /dev/dm-0                                  3 sec
Running test file-verify /data/file                                 3 sec

Note that the sdc2 timeout isn't a failure, it's just that emulation on
qemu is slow enough that it takes 1min20s to run and I time out tests
after 60s in the harness to prevent something stalling forever.
