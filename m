For the temperature hints the only public user I known is rocksdb, and
that only started working when Hans fixed a brown paperbag bug in the
rocksdb code a while ago.  Given that f2fs interprets the hints I suspect
something in the Android world does as well, maybe Bart knows more.

For the separate write streams the usage I want for them is poor mans
zones - e.g. write N LBAs sequentially into a separate write streams
and then eventually discard them together.  This will fit nicely into
f2fs and the pending xfs work as well as quite a few userspace storage
systems.  For that the file system or application needs to query
the number of available write streams (and in the bitmap world their
numbers of they are distontigous) and the size your can fit into the
"reclaim unit" in FDP terms.  I've not been bothering you much with
the latter as it is an easy retrofit once the I/O path bits lands.

I don't think the multiple write streams interface applies to SCSIs
write streams, as they enforce a relative temperature, and they don't
have the concept of how much you can write into an "reclaim unit".

OTOH there isn't much you need to query for them anyway, as the
temperature hints have always been defined as pure hints with all
up and downsides of that.

FYI, I think it's always fine and easy to map the temperature hits to
write streams if that's all the driver offers.  It loses a lot of the
capapilities, but as long as it doesn't enforce a lower level interface
that never exposes more that's fine.
