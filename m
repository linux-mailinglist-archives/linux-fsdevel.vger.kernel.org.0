The main requirement (especially for buffered IO) is that we've set the
address space operations structure either to the regular fuse one or to
the fuse+iomap ops before clearing INEW because the iomap/buffered-io.c
code assumes that cannot change on a live inode.

So I /think/ we could ask the fuse server at inode instantiation time
(which, if I'm reading the code correctly, is when iget5_locked gives
fuse an INEW inode and calls fuse_init_inode) provided it's ok to upcall
to userspace at that time.  Alternately I guess we could extend struct
fuse_attr with another FUSE_ATTR_ flag, I think?

I think this would work in many places, except for filesystems with
64-bit inumbers on 32-bit machines.  That might be a good argument for
continuing to pass along the nodeid and fuse_inode::orig_ino like it
does now.  Plus there are some filesystems that synthesize inode numbers
so tying the two together might not be feasible/desirable anyway.

Though one nice feature of letting fuse have its own nodeids might be
that if the in-memory index switches to a tree structure, then it could
be more compact if the filesystem's inumbers are fairly sparse like xfs.
OTOH the current inode hashtable has been around for a very long time so
that might not be a big concern.  For fuse2fs it doesn't matter since
ext4 inumbers are u32.
