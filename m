The idea was to give userspace some way to serialize processing of
non-cooperative event notifications and uffdio operations running in
parallel. It's not necessary to block uffdio operations from happening
before changes to the memory map, but with the mmap_lock synchronization
that already was there adding mmap_chaning that will prevent uffdio
operations when mmap_lock is taken for write was the simplest thing to do.

When CRIU does post-copy restore of a process, its uffd monitor reacts to
page fault and non-cooperative notifications and also performs a background
copy of the memory contents from the saved state to the address space of
the process being restored.

Since non-cooperative events may happen completely independent from the
uffd monitor, there are cases when the uffd monitor couldn't identify the
order of events, like  e.g. what won the race on mmap_lock, the process
thread doing fork or the uffd monitor's uffdio_copy.

In the fork vs uffdio_copy example, without mmap_changing, if the
uffdio_copy takes the mmap_lock first, the new page will be present in the
parent by the time copy_page_range() is called and the page will appear in
the child's memory mappings by the time uffd monitor gets notification
about the fork event. However, if the fork() is the first to take the
mmap_lock, the new page will appear in the parent address space after
copy_page_range() and it won't be mapped in the child's address space.

With mmap_changing and current locking with mmap_lock, we have a guarantee
that uffdio_copy will bail out if fork already took mmap_lock and the
monitor can act appropriately.

mremap_userfaultfd_prep() is done after page tables are moved because it
initializes uffd context on the new_vma and if the actual remap fails,
there's no point of doing it.
Since mrpemap holds mmap_lock for write it does not matter if mmap_changed
is updated before or after page tables are moved. In the time between
mmap_lock is released and the UFFD_EVENT_REMAP is delivered to the uffd
monitor, mmap_chaging will remain >0 and uffdio operations will bail out.

The notifications are useful because uffd monitor knows what memory should
not be filled with uffdio_copy. Indeed there was no interest in taking
mmap_lock for write in madvise, so there could be race between madvise and
uffdio operations. This race essentially prevents uffd monitor from running
the background copy in a separate thread, and with your change this should
be possible.

In the fork case without mmap_changing the child process may be get data or
zeroes depending on the race for mmap_lock between the fork and
uffdio_copy and -EEXIST is not enough for monitor to detect what was the
ordering between fork and uffdio_copy.

The write-lock is not a requirement here for correctness and I don't see
why we would need userfaultfd_remove_prep().

As I've said earlier, having a write-lock here will let CRIU to run
background copy in parallel with processing of uffd events, but I don't
feel strongly about doing it.
