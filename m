That sounds like a good idea to me, as well.

Instead of trying to invite "all the useful people" on
a few fixed topics, which LSF/MM did very well, but which
the Linux community has long outgrown, resulting in us
being unable to invite some very good people, we can turn
things on its head a little organization wise.

We can host a number of (half day?) mini conferences on
various Linux kernel topics, maybe still with some focus
around LSF/MM/IO, and have a small number of general track
discussion sessions.

Once the topics of the mini conferences have been chosen,
people can figure out whether or not they want to attend
that year.

This could help us avoid the "oops, we couldn't invite two
of the people who really should have been here for this=20
discussion" issue that has been difficult to avoid with=20
LSF/MM having more interest, and more topics, than available
slots for people to attend.

TL;DR: decide on topics, not invitees.
