One of the challenges is that the attribution is not necessasrily
accurate.  One of the CPU's was running an ext4 workqueue task (which
was apparntly making forward progress) at the time of the crash.

It should also be noted that apparently there is a potential patch
which seems to fix the problem, and it's solely in the fs/eventpoll.c.
Unfortunately, it was not in the lore.kernel.org archives, since
apparently it wasn't cc'ed there.  It's in the syzkaller-bugs Google
Groups archive, though, since Pauolo Abeni cc'ed the
syzkaller-bugs@googlegroups.com, but not the lore archive, on his
test:
