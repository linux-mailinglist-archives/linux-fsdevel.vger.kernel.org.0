As Linus commented in another thread, this patch is really ugly.

I'd suggest to change to the following one, any comment is welcome!

Subject: [PATCH 2/4] fs/splice: add private flags for cross-check in two ends

Pages are transferred via pipe/splice between different subsystems.

The source subsystem may know if spliced pages are readable or
writable. The sink subsystem may know if spliced pages need to
write to or read from.

Add two pair of private flags, so that the source subsystem and
sink subsystem can run cross-check about page use correctness,
and they are supposed to be used in case of communicating over
direct pipe only. Generic splice and pipe code is supposed to
not touch the two pair of private flags.
