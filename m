How does this work today then? Is it actually the case that initramfs
just cannot be used on an IMA-enabled system, or it can but it leaves
the initramfs unverified and we're trying to fix that? I had assumed the
latter.

The embedded initramfs can do other things, it just has to do
the xattr stuff in addition, no?

How? The /init in the embedded initramfs is part of a trusted kernel
image that has been verified by the bootloader.

If it were signed yes, but you just said that it isn't possible to sign
it in all cases (if initramfs is generated locally). I actually didn't
follow that bit -- if initramfs is generated locally, and it isn't
possible to sign locally, where would the IMA hashes for the contents of
the initramfs come from? Is the idea that each file within the initramfs
would be an existing, signed, file, but you could locally create an initramfs
with some subset of those unmodified files? Even assuming this is the
case, isn't the eventual intention to also appraise directories, to
prevent holes where files might be moved around/deleted/renamed etc, so
this problem would resurface anyway?
Also eventually we need to check special nodes like device nodes etc to
make sure they haven't been tampered with, as in Rob's urandom
suggestion?
