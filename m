It seems that VFS is not very concerned about the values of filesystem,
such as inode nlinks. And the defination of whether it is correct or incorrect
is left to the specific filesystem. However, in some places do have limit
up to s_max_links. Perhaps the limit down to zero is also reasonable.
Is that rightï¼Ÿ
