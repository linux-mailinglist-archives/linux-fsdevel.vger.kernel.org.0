I think you're missing the context.  There are bugs in how this filesystem
handles intentionally-corrupted filesystems.  That's being reported as
a critical bug because apparently some distributions automount HFS/HFS+
filesystems presented to them on a USB key.  Nobody is being paid to fix
these bugs.  Nobody is volunteering to fix these bugs out of the kindness
of their heart.  What choice do we have but to remove the filesystem,
regardless of how many happy users it has?
