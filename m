Here the single .ra_pages may not work, that is why this patch stores
the willneed range in maple tree, please see the following words from
the original RH report:

"
Increasing read ahead is not an option as it has a mixed I/O workload of
random I/O and sequential I/O, so that a large read ahead is very counterproductive
to the random I/O and is unacceptable.
"

Also almost all these advises(SEQUENTIA, WILLNEED, NORMAL, RANDOM)
ignore the passed range, and the behavior becomes all or nothing,
instead of something only for the specified range, which may not
match with man, please see 'man posix_fadvise':

	```
       POSIX_FADV_NORMAL
              Indicates that the application has no advice to give about its access
			  pattern for the specified data.  If no advice is given for an open file,
			  this is the default assumption.

       POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL
              The application expects to access the specified data sequentially (with
			  lower offsets read before higher ones).

       POSIX_FADV_RANDOM
              The specified data will be accessed in random order.

       POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE
              The specified data will be accessed only once.

              In kernels before 2.6.18, POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE had the same semantics as
			  POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED.  This was probably a bug; since kernel 2.6.18, this
			  flag is a no-op.

       POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED
              The specified data will be accessed in the near future.
	```

It is even worse for readahead() syscall:

	```
	DESCRIPTION
	       readahead()  initiates readahead on a file so that subsequent reads from that
		   file will be satisfied from the cache, and not block on disk I/O (assuming the
		   readahead was initiated early enough and that other activity on the system did
		   not in the meantime flush pages from the cache).
	```


Thanks,
Ming
