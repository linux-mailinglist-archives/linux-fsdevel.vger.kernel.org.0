Sorry, I transposed them..

Sure, put that in the Patch 7/9, I'll move it to the cover letter as
well.

Currently, when a fixed worker fetch all the works from its private work
list, I use a temporary acct struct to hold them. This means at that
moment the cancellation cannot find these works which are going to run
but not in the private work list already. This won't be a big problem,
another acct member in io_worker{} should be good enough to resolve
that.
