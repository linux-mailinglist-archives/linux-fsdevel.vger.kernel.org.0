It's still somewhat weird to have user_data have special meaning, you're
now having the kernel interpret it while every other command it's just
an opaque that is passed through.

But it could of course work, and the app could embed the necessary
u32/u64 in some other structure that's persistent across IO. If it
doesn't have that, then it'd need to now have one allocated and freed
across the lifetime of the IO.

If we're going that route, it'd be better to define the write such that
you're passing in the necessary information upfront. In syscall terms,
then that'd be something ala:

ssize_t my_append_write(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt,
			off_t *offset, int flags);

where *offset is copied out when the write completes. That removes the
need to abuse user_data, with just providing the storage pointer for the
offset upfront.
