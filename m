This one ^^^^^^^^ topic should still get its own session, ideally with
Martin Petersen and John Garry running it.  A few cloud vendors'
software defined storage stacks can support multi-lba atomic writes, and
some database software could take advantage of that to reduce nested WAL
overhead.

After 3 years of sparse review comments, I decided to withdraw
FIEXCHANGE_RANGE from general consideration after realizing that very
few filesystems actually have the infrastructure to support atomic file
contents exchange, hence there's little to be gained from undertaking
fsdevel bikeshedding.

TBH, most of my fs complaints these days are managerial problems (Are we
spending too much time on LTS?  How on earth do we prioritize projects
with all these drive by bots??  Why can't we support large engineering
efforts better???) than technical.

(I /am/ willing to have a "Online fs metadata reconstruction: How does
it work, and can I have some of what you're smoking?" BOF tho)
