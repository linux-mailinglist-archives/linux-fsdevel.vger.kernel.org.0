The right approach in my opinion is to start submitting patches to fs/fat
to add exfat support.  But more importantly it is to first coordinate
with other stakeholder most importantly the fs/fat/ maintainer and the
dosfstools maintainers as our local experts for fat-like file systems
instead of shooting from the hip.

Especially with boot time automounting it could happen.  Never mind that
we do not add duplicate file system drivers (or drivers in general) to
the kernel.

No.  Assuming we even want the current codebase (which only you and
Greg seem to think so), that fat16/32 code simply has to go.

That isn't the point.  Everyone who submitted a file system had a clear
plan where they wanted to go.  You just took someone elses out of tree
code, apparently didn't even try to understand it and are not able to
come up with what your plan for it is.  And even after repeated
questions on what that plan is duck the question and instead attack the
people asking for it.
