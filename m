Heh, I once made this argument as well, but it does work in some
traditional cases so we decided to keep it around. It is onerous to
track though.

OFD and flock locks specifically do not do any sort of deadlock
detection (thank goodness).

I think the moral of the story is that you don't really want to use
classic POSIX locks in anything that involves locking between different
threads, as their design just doesn't mesh well with that model.

We did try to convey that in the fcntl manpage in the lead-in to OFD
locks section:

       *  The threads in a process share locks.  In other words, a multi‚Äê
          threaded  program  can't  use  record  locking  to  ensure that
          threads don't simultaneously access the same region of a file.

Maybe we need to revise that to be more clear? Or possibly add something
that points out that this can also manifest as false-positives in
deadlock detection?
