CCed fsdevel. Actually replying here because the quoting in Ibrahim's email
got somehow broken which made it very hard to understand.

So D state is expected when waiting for response. We are using
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep (the above commit had to be effectively
reverted). But we are also setting TASK_KILLABLE and TASK_FREEZABLE so that
we don't block hibernation and tasks can be killed when fanotify listener
misbehaves.

But what confuses me is the following: You have fanotify instance to which
you've got fd from fanotify_init(). For any process to be hanging, this fd
must be still held open by some process. Otherwise the fanotify instance
gets destroyed and all processes are free to run (they get FAN_ALLOW reply
if they were already waiting). So the fact that you see processes hanging
when your fanotify listener crashes means that you have likely leaked the
fd to some other process (lsof should be able to tell you which process has
still handle to fanotify instance). And the kernel has no way to know this
is not the process that will eventually read these events and reply...

I agree this would be a sensible protocol for updates. For unplanned crashes
I agree we need something like the "moderated" mount option.

If the fanotify fd got closed and the instance shutdown, this would be
indeed a serious bug (likely UAF issue). But so far I rather suspect the fd
is just in some fd table somewhere...
