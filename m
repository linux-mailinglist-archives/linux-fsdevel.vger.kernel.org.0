Yea.

I was wondering if the right approach could be to pass through a kiocb
instead of gfp_t. There's obviously precedent for that in
file_operations, and then IOCB_NOWAIT could be used to represent the the
intent to not block. It'd be a bit weird in the sense that currently
there'd probably be no callback - but that seems fairly minor. And who
knows,

POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED has similar problems to POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED, so it'd
be nice to come up with an API change to vfs_fadvise that'd support
both. Obviously there also could be a POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED_ASYNC, but ...

I'm a bit out of my depth here: Would __GFP_NOWAIT actually be suitable
to indicate that no blocking IO is to be executed by the FS? E.g. for
metadata? As far as I can tell that's also a problem, not just reclaim
to make space for the to-be-read data.

Cool!
