Thanks, that's very useful.

I guess one question is which ones are genuine SLAB/SLUB differences and not
e.g. some artifact of different cache layout or something. For example it
seems suspicious if results are widely different between architectures.

E.g. will-it-scale writeseek3_scalability regresses on arm64 and amd, but
improves on intel? Or is something wrong with the data, all columns for that
whole benchmark suite are identical.

hackbench ("smaller is better") seems drastically better on arm64 (30%
median time reduction?) and amd (80% reduction?!?), but 10% slower intel?

redis seems a bit improved on arm64, slightly worse on intel but much worse
on amd.

specjbb similar story, also I thought it was a java focused benchmark,
should it really be exercising kernel slab allocators in such notable way?

I guess netpipe is the least surprising as networking was always mentioned
in SLAB vs SLUB discussions.
