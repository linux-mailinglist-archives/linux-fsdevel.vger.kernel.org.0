Hi Christian,

My understanding of FMODE_NOWAIT is "this file support nowait IO". Just 
like what Dominique

said, io_uring issue a request two rounds(let's simplify it here since 
no apoll or task work involved),

and the first round is  a nowait/nonblock try, the second one is an 
offload-ed block try. So besides

a "ability" flag(FMODE_NOWAIT), we still need a "one-round" flag to 
point out that "we do need to

do nowait IO this time".

I've no strong opinion here, I kept it here as a flag variable to make it

more extendable in the future.


Thanks,
