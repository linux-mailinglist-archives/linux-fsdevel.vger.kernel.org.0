Tony,

this is super interesting details. I'm leaving for few days so I will
not be able to look into it until I am back but here is my
interpretation of your findings:

f38c7e3abfba makes it more likely that your task ends up in a fd read
wait queue. Previously the io_uring req queuing was failing and
returning EAGAIN. Now it ends up using io uring fast poll.

When the core dump gets written through a pipe, pipe_write must block
waiting for some event. If the task gets waken up by the io_uring wait
queue entry instead, it must somehow make pipe_write fails.

So the problem must be a mix of TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL and the fact that
io_uring wait queue entries aren't cleaned up while doing the core
dump.

I have a new modif to try out. I'll hopefully be able to submit a patch
to fix that once I come back (I cannot do it now or else, I'll never
leave ;-))
