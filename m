I thought that it was safe, but I thought about it a bit more, and it
seems that it is unsafe -- if you IORING_REGISTER_FILES to register the
dirfd and then close the dirfd, you'll get a file_count of 1, while you
can submit concurrent operations.  So I'll remove the conditional
locking.  Thanks!

(If not for IORING_REGISTER_FILES, it seems safe, because then
io_file_get() will hold a(t least one) reference on the file while the
operation is in flight, so then if file_count(req->file) == 1 here,
then it means that the file is no longer referenced by any fdtable,
and nobody else should be able to get a reference to it -- but that's
a bit of a useless optimization.)

(Logic was taken from __fdget_pos, where it is safe for a different
reason, i.e. __fget_light will not bump the refcount iff current->files
is unshared.)

My aim was to only make the minimally required change initially, but
to make that optimization possible in the future (e.g. by reserving the
right to either update or not update the file position) -- but I'll
try doing the optimization now.
