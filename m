I think it's a bit reductive to suggest that enabled=madvise means all madvise
calls though. I don't think anyone would suggest MADV_DONTNEED should be ignored
if enabled=never. MADV_COLLAPSE just happens to be implemented on top of the THP
logic. But it's a different feature in my view.

OK fair enough. Just giving my 2 cents.
