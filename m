See the comment--I was worried about crashes: the change attribute isn't
on disk at the time the client requests it, so after a crash the client
may see it go backward.  (And then could see it repeat a value, possibly
with different file contents.)

Combining it with the ctime means we get something that behaves
correctly even in that case--unless the clock goes backwards.
