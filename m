I was thinking of the -E2BIG return but you are right, the patch
wouldn't change this. If, for example, you read 8 bytes across a page
boundary and it faults, load_unaligned_zeropad() returns fewer
characters copied, implying the source was null-terminated.
read_word_at_a_time(), OTOH, panics in the next
byte-at-a-time loop. But it wouldn't return -E2BIG either, so it doesn't
matter for the caller.

It's mostly about keeping the current behaviour w.r.t. page boundaries.
Not a strong opinion either. The change would be to not read across page
boundaries.

No, I meant the padding of the source when a fault occurs. The write to
the destination would only be a single '\0' byte. It's the destination
safe termination vs. panic above.

Thanks for checking.
