No, I don't think there are otherwise they would have the same bug that
binder had. io_uring comes closest but they have their own task work
and deferred close implementation.

I'm sorry, I don't quite understand you here.

What binder is doing iirc is that it's performing an ioctl() using a fd
to /dev/binderfs/$device-node or similar. The fatal flaw is that binder
now allows that fd to be closed during that ioctl - and by accident at
that. It's effectively closing a file it's relying on to not go away.
That's the original nonsense/creativity that necessitates this whole
manual task work shenanigans binder is doing. Unless I misremember.

But that's really frowned upon generally and absolutely not encouraged
by providing a generic interface for this stuff.

Sure, we have some users in the kernel that do stuff like call
close_fd() on a file descriptor they just installed into their file
descriptor table. That's usually bad design with maybe a few valid
exceptions. One example where that's still done and should be fixed is
e.g., cachefiles in fs/cachefiles/ondemand.c. The point is that they at
least close a file descriptor that they just installed and that they
don't rely on being valid.

So really, I need more details why without this interface it would
prevent Rust from implementing safe file descriptor closing because
right now all I see is a design flaw in binder being promoted to a
generic interface. And unless there's detailed reasons for it's
existence we're not going to do it.
