If any part of a DIO fails, we fail the entire IO. When we split a
DIO into multiple bios and one reports an error, we don't know track
where in the IO it actually failed, we just fail the entire IO.

e.g. how do you report correct partial completion to userspace when
a DIO gets split into 3 pieces and the middle one fails? There are
two ranges that actually completed, but we can only report one of
them....

And, really, we still need to report that an IO failed to userspace,
because mission critical apps care more about the fact that an IO
failure occurred than silently swallowing the IO error with a
(potentially incorrect) partial IO completion notification.

Cheers,

Dave.
