That sounds like 5.10-stable is missing some of the cancelation
backports, and your setup makes the cancelation stall because of that.
Need to go over the 11/12/13 fixes and ensure that we've got everything
we need for those stable versions, particularly 5.10.

OK, so that one is also using task_work for the retry based async
buffered reads, so it makes sense.

Maybe a temporary work-around is to use 06af8679449d and eliminate the
pipe based coredump?
