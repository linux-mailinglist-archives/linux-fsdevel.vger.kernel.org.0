Is that so? I think found some incompatibilities in the patches (need to 
double check), but doesn't it just do normal fuse operations and then 
replies with an ioctl to do passthrough? BPF is used for additional 
filtering, that would have to be done otherwise in userspace.

Really difficult in the current patch set and data structures is to see 
what is actually BPF and what is passthrough.
