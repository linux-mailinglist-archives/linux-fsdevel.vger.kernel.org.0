Hi.

My colleagues and I have been investigating the issue addressed by this patch
and have discovered some significant concerns that require broader discussion.

### Socket Leak Issue

After testing this patch extensively, I've confirmed it introduces a socket leak
when TCP connections don't complete proper termination (e.g., when FIN packets
are dropped). The leak manifests as a continuous increase in TCP slab usage:

I've documented this issue with a reproducer in Bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219972#c0

The key issue appears to stem from the interaction between the SMB client and TCP
socket lifecycle management:

1. Removing `sk->sk_net_refcnt = 1` causes TCP timers to be terminated early in
    `tcp_close()` via the `inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync()` call when
    `!sk->sk_net_refcnt`
2. This early timer termination prevents proper reference counting resolution
    when connections don't complete the 4-way TCP termination handshake
3. The resulting socket references are never fully released, leading to a leak

#### Timeline of Related Changes

1. v4.2-rc1 26abe14379f8 ("net: Modify sk_alloc to not reference count the netns of kernel sockets")
    - Added `sk_net_refcnt` field to distinguish user sockets (=1) from kernel sockets (=0)
    - Kernel sockets don't hold netns references, which can lead to potential UAF issues

2. v6.9-rc2 151c9c724d05: ("tcp: properly terminate timers for kernel sockets")
    - Modified `tcp_close()` to check `sk->sk_net_refcnt` and explicitly terminate timers for kernel sockets (=0)
    - This prevents UAF when netns is destroyed before socket timers complete
    - **Key change**: If `!sk->sk_net_refcnt`, call `inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync()`

3. v6.12-rc7 ef7134c7fc48: ("smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace")
    - Fixed netns UAF in CIFS by manually setting `sk->sk_net_refcnt = 1`
    - Also called `maybe_get_net()` to maintain netns references
    - This effectively made kernel sockets behave like user sockets for reference counting

4. v6.13-rc4 e9f2517a3e18: ("smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after rmmod")
    - Problem commit: Removed `sk->sk_net_refcnt = 1` setting
    - Changed to using explicit `get_net()/put_net()` at CIFS layer
    - This change leads to socket leaks because timers are terminated early

### Lockdep Warning Analysis

I've also investigated the lockdep warning mentioned in the patch. My analysis
suggests it may be a false positive rather than an actual deadlock. The crash
actually occurs in the lockdep subsystem itself (null pointer dereference in
`check_wait_context()`), not in the CIFS or networking code directly.

The procedure for the null pointer dereference is as follows:

When lockdep is enabled, the lock class "slock-AF_INET-CIFS" is set when a socket
connection is established.

```
cifs_do_mount
   cifs_mount
     mount_get_conns
       cifs_get_tcp_session
         ip_connect
           generic_ip_connect
             cifs_reclassify_socket4
               sock_lock_init_class_and_name(sk, "slock-AF_INET-CIFS",
                 lockdep_init_map
                   lockdep_init_map_wait
                     lockdep_init_map_type
                       lockdep_init_map_type
                         register_lock_class
                           __set_bit(class - lock_classes, lock_classes_in_use);
```

When the module is unloaded, the lock class is cleaned up.

```
free_mod_mem
   lockdep_free_key_range
     __lockdep_free_key_range
       zap_class
         __clear_bit(class - lock_classes, lock_classes_in_use);
```

After the module is uninstalled and the network connection is restored, the
timer is woken up.

```
run_timer_softirq
   run_timer_base
     __run_timers
       call_timer_fn
         tcp_write_timer
           bh_lock_sock
             spin_lock(&((__sk)->sk_lock.slock))
               _raw_spin_lock
                 lock_acquire
                   __lock_acquire
                     check_wait_context
                       hlock_class
                        if (!test_bit(class_idx, lock_classes_in_use)) {
                           return NULL;
                       hlock_class(next)->wait_type_inner; // Null pointer dereference
```

The problem lies within lockdep, as Kuniyuki says:

Regarding the deadlock issue, it is clear that the locks mentioned in the deadlock warning
do not belong to the same lock instance. A deadlock should not occur.

### Discussion Points

1. API Design Question: Is this fundamentally an issue with how CIFS uses the socket
    API, or is it a networking layer issue that should handle socket cleanup differently?

2. Approach to Resolution: Would it be better to:
    - Revert to the original solution (setting `sk->sk_net_refcnt = 1`) from ef7134c7fc48?
    - Work with networking subsystem maintainers on a more comprehensive solution that
      handles socket cleanup properly?

3.  CVE Process Question: Given that CVE-2024-54680 appears to "fix" a non-existent issue
     while introducing an actual vulnerability, what's the appropriate way to address this?

What's the best path forward?
