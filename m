Are they though?  What about a write that crosses an extent boundary?
iomap_write_iter() gets called once per extent and I have a feeling that
you really need to revert the entire write, rather than just the part
of the write that was to that extent.

Anyway, my question was whether we need to revert or whether the worker
thread can continue from where we left off.
