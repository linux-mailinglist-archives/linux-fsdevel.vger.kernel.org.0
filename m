Well spotted, but is this sufficient to fix the issue?

If Thread2 gets scheduled off before the wake_up but after removing the
block, then it seems like it could hit the same problem regardless of
whether you took the spinlock or not in that codepath.

The core problem seems to be that we don't have any guarantee that
waiter "b" will still be around once the spinlock has been dropped in
the unlock codepath.
