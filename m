With pleasure, I take whatever help you offer. Right now I'm quite
jumping between between different projects and I'm not too happy that I
still didn't sent out a new patch version yet. (And the atomic-open
branch also needs updates).

Merging requests requires a bit scanning through the CQEs on the
userspace side, it all arrives randomly. I haven't even tried yet to
merge requests, I have just seen with debugging that ring the queue gets
filled with requests that belong together.

Out of interest, are you using libfuse or your own kernel interface
library? I would be quite interested to know if the fuse-uring
kernel/userspace and then libfuse interface matches your needs. Example,
our next-gen DDN file system runs in spdk reactor context and I had to
update our own code base and libfuse to support ring polling. So one
project outside of libfuse example/ and already some changes needed...
Another change I haven't implemented yet in libfuse is ring request
buffer registration with the file system (for network rdma).

Btw, I just run into bug that came up with FUSE_CAP_WRITEBACK_CACHE - I
definitely don't claim that all code paths are perfectly tested already
(fixed now in the fuse-uring-for-6.8 branch).


Thanks,
Bernd
