It'll only be finished once the apps are adapted, or they'll stop to
work after 2037 anyway.

I've informed Firefox at
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1673771.  For Google
products I guess someone else will have to do (I'm really unfamiliar
with their things, and they often block my proxy server despite I've
never used the proxy to attack them).

It may also introduce incompatibility: consider a seccomp sandbox which
does not handle fstat on LoongArch because __NR_fstat is not defined in
the UAPI header.  Now the kernel is updated to provide fstat the sandbox
will be broken: a blocklist sandbox will fail to block fstat and leave a
security hole; a whitelist sandbox will fail to allow fstat and blow up
the app if some runtime library is updated to "take the advantage" of
fstat.

My preference (most preferable to least preferable):

1. Not to add them back at all.  Just let the downstream to patch the
kernel if they must support a broken userspace.
2. Add them back with a configurable option (depending on CONFIG_EXPERT:
the distros are already enabling this anyway), make them documented
clearly as only intended to support a broken userspace and removable in
the future.
3. Add it back only for 64-bit.  Add a #if **now** for ruling it out for
32-bit despite we don't have 32-bit support, to make it clear we'll not
flatter broken userspace anymore when we make the 32-bit port.
<rant>4. Remove seccomp.  Personally I really wish to put this on the
top.</rant>

BTW has anyone tried to use Landlock for those browser sandboxes
instead?
