Al, thank you for this information.  It does shine a little light on where
dragons may be hiding.  I was wondering if you could comment on a related
issue.

linkat does allow specifing AT_EMPTY_PATH.  However, it requires
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH.  I saw that a patch went into the kernel to remove
this restriction, but was shortly thereafter reverted with a comment
to the effect of "We'll have to think about this a little more".  Then,
radio silence.  Other than requiring /proc be mounted to bypass, what
problem does this restriction solve?

Also related, the thing I'm even more interested in is the ability to
create an O_TMPFILE, populate it, set permissions, etc, and then make
it appear in a directory.  The problem is I almost always don't want it
to just appear, but rather atomically replace an older version of the
file.

dfd = openat(x, "y", O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC | O_DIRECTORY, 0)
fd = openat(dfd, ".", O_RDWR | O_CLOEXEC | O_TMPFILE, 0600)
do stuff with fd
fsync(fd)
linkat(fd, "", dfd, "z", AT_EMPTY_PATH | AT_REPLACE?)
close(fd)
fsync(dfd)
close(dfd)

The AT_REPLACE flag has been suggested before to work around the EEXIST
behavior.  Alternatively, renameat2 could accept AT_EMPTY_PATH for
olddirfd/oldpath, but fixing up linkat seems a little cleaner.  Without
this, it hardly seems worthwhile to use O_TMPFILE at all, and instead
just go through the hassle of creating the file with a random name
(plus exposing that file and having to possibly rm it in case of an error).

I haven't been able to find any explanation for the AT_REPLACE idea not
gaining traction.  Is there some security reason for this?

Thanks
