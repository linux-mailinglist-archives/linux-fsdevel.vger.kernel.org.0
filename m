Correct, any SQE that we can do without switching, we will.

OK, I think I follow your concern. So you'd like to setup the rings from
a _different_ user, and then later on use it for submission for SQEs that
a specific user. So sort of the same as our initial discussion, except
the mapping would be static. The difference being that you might setup
the ring from a different user than the user that would be submitting IO
on it?

If so, then we do need something to support that, probably an
IORING_REGISTER_CREDS or similar. This would allow you to replace the
creds you currently have in ctx->creds with whatever new one.

I think we're talking about the same thing, just different views of it :-)
