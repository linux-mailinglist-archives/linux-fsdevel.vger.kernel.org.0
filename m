Got it, thank you for making it simple.
Overall if I try to put the tradeoffs of moving to indirect-offset
(compared to current scheme)=E2=80=93

Upside:
- cqe res/flags would be intact, avoids future-headaches as you mentioned
- short-write cases do not have to be failed in lower-layers (as
cqe->res is there to report bytes-copied)

Downside:
- We may not be able to use RWF_APPEND, and need exposing a new
type/flag (RWF_INDIRECT_OFFSET etc.) user-space. Not sure if this
sounds outrageous, but is it OK to have uring-only flag which can be
combined with RWF_APPEND?
-  Expensive compared to sending results in cqe itself. But I agree
that this may not be major, and only for one type of write.
