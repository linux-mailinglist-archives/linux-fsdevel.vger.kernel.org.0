it will bloat binary somewhat, but considering it's all in one
place -- io_issue_sqe(), it's workable.

Not nice to have send/recv msg in the list, but I admit they
may do some crazy things. What can be traced for them? Because
at the moment of issue_sqe() not everything is read from the
userspace.

see: io_sendmsg() { ...; io_sendmsg_copy_hdr(); },

will copy header only in io_sendmsg() in most cases, and
then stash it for re-issuing if needed.

Copying a reply to another message to keep clear out
of misunderstanding.

"io_issue_sqe() may return 0 but leave the request inflight,
which will be completed asynchronously e.g. by IRQ, not going
through io_issue_sqe() or any io_read()/etc helpers again, and
after last audit_end() had already happened.
That's the case with read/write/timeout, but is not true for
open/etc."

And there is interest in async send/recv[msg] as well (via
IRQ as described, callbacks, etc.).

Ok, depends where it steers, but there may be a requirement to
not sleep for some hooks because of not having a sleepable context.
