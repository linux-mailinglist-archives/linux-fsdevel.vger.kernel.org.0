I was under the apparently mistaken impression that the io_uring
task_work_add only comes from the io_uring userspace helper threads.
Those are definitely suppressed by my change.

Do you have any idea in the code where io_uring code is being called in
an interrupt context?  I would really like to trace that code path so I
have a better grasp on what is happening.

If task_work_add is being called from interrupt context then something
additional from what I have proposed certainly needs to be done.
