I think I said it somewhere else: I'm not opposing your position on
kfruncs in a sense I understand that's kinda the model that you have to
push for. But you have to admit that this out-of-tree portion is very
hard to swallow if you've been hit by out of tree modules and their
complaints about removed EXPORT_SYMBOL*()s.

I'm still rather hesitant about this because I find it hard to figure
out how this will go down in practice. But, especially with the internal
idmapped mount api. This is a very hidden and abstracted away
implementation around an opaque type and I'm not yet ready to let
modules or bpf programs peek into it's implementation details. I hope
that's understandable.
