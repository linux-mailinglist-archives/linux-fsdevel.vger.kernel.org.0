Olivier, I sent a 5.10 version for Nathan, any chance you can test this
one for the current kernels? Basically this one should work for 5.11+,
and the later 5.10 version is just for 5.10. I'm going to send it out
separately for review.

I do think this is the right solution, barring a tweak maybe on testing
notify == TWA_SIGNAL first before digging into the task struct. But the
principle is sound, and it'll work for other users of TWA_SIGNAL as
well. None right now as far as I can tell, but the live patching is
switching to TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL as well which will also cause issues with
coredumps potentially.
