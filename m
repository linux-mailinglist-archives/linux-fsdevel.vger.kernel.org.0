IMA should remeasure the file when it has visibly changed for another thread or process.

I was wondering whether to use the existing inode_eq_iversion() for all
other filesystems than overlayfs, nfs, and possibly other ones (which ones?)
where we would use the vfs_getattr_nosec() via a case on inode->i_sb->s_magic?
If so, would this function be generic enough to be a public function for libfs.c?

I'll hopefully be able to test the proposed patch tomorrow.
