So, what about introducing new xattrs for every attribute with this pattern?

system.attr.readonly
system.attr.hidden
system.attr.system
system.attr.archive
system.attr.temporary
system.attr.offline
system.attr.not_content_indexed

All those attributes can be set by user, I took names from SMB, which
matches NTFS and which subsets are used by other filesystems like FAT,
exFAT, NFS4, UDF, ...

Every xattr would be in system.attr namespace and would contain either
value 0 or 1 based on that fact if is set or unset. If the filesystem
does not support particular attribute then xattr get/set would return
error that it does not exist.

This would be possible to use by existing userspace getfattr/setfattr
tools and also by knfsd/ksmbd via accessing xattrs directly.
