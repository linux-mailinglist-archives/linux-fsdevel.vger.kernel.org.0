Ugh, I managed to not notice that I was looking at fdget_pos and that
it's not the same as fdget by the time I wrote two paragraphs... These
functions all have too many wrappers and too similar names for a quick
look before work.

Right, that makes sense, and invalidates everything I said after that
anyway but it's not like looking stupid ever killed anyone.

Ok so it would require adding a new wrapper from struct file to struct
fd that'd eventually take the lock and set FDPUT_POS_UNLOCK for... not
fdput_pos but another function for that stopping short of fdput...
Then just call that around both vfs_llseek and vfs_getdents calls; which
is the easy part.

(Or possibly call mutex_lock directly like Dylan did in [1]...)

I'll be honest though I'm thankful for your explanations but I think
I'll just do like Stefan and stop trying for now: the only reason I've
started this was because I wanted to play with io_uring for a new toy
project and it felt awkward without a getdents for crawling a tree; and
I'm long past the point where I should have thrown the towel and just
make that a sequential walk.
There's too many "conditional patches" (NOWAIT, end of dir indicator)
that I don't care about and require additional work to rebase
continuously so I'll just leave it up to someone else who does care.

So to that someone: feel free to continue from these branches (I've
included the fix for kernfs_fop_readdir that Dan Carpenter reported):
https://github.com/martinetd/linux/commits/io_uring_getdents
https://github.com/martinetd/liburing/commits/getdents

Or just start over, there's not that much code now hopefully the
baseline requirements have gotten a little bit clearer.


Sorry for stirring the mess and leaving halfway, if nobody does continue
I might send a v3 when I have more time/energy in a few months, but it
won't be quick.
