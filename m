I dug up my old discussion with the current vfat maintainer and he said
something to the affect of, "leave the existing code alone, make a new
filesystem, I don't want anything to do with exfat".

And I don't blame them, vfat is fine as-is and stable and shouldn't be
touched for new things.

We can keep non-vfat filesystems from being mounted with the exfat
codebase, and make things simpler for everyone involved.

I don't think it should stay in there, let's drop it from the exfat
code.

As for the other issues discussed here in this thread:
  - yes, putting a filesystem in staging is extra work overall, but for
    projects that want to do that extra work, wonderful, do it here in a
    common place for everyone to work on together.
  - working on in a common place is what we need for exfat right now,
    as there are 40+ different github forks and no one knows which one
    is "correct" or most up to date.  We needed to decide on "one" and
    here it is, the in-tree one.
  - for vfs developers who don't want to even look at the crud in
    staging (remember, it's TAINT_CRAP if you load code from here),
    don't.  Just keep on your own normal development cycles and if you
    break any staging code, it's fine, I will fix it up no complaints at
    all.
  - staging code is for crappy code to get fixed up.  If it isn't
    constantly updated, it will be dropped.  Yes, there is code in there
    that probably should be dropped now as I haven't done a sweep in a
    few years, suggestions always welcome.  There is also code that
    needs to be moved out with just a bit more work needed (greybus,
    comedi, speakup, etc.)  Some of that is underway right now.

thanks,
