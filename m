We're still talking past each other.
0 is an invalid bpf object. Not file.
There is a difference.
The kernel is breaking user space by returning non-file FDs in 0,1,2.
Especially as fd = 1 and 2.
ensure_good_fd() in libbpf is a library workaround to make sure bpf objects
are not the reason for user app brekage.
I firmly believe that making kernel return socket FDs and other special FDs with fd >=3
(under new sysctl, for example) will prevent user space breakage.

And to answer Ted's question..
Yes. It's a security issue, but it's the other way around.
The kernel returning non vfs file FD in [0,1,2] range is a security issue.
I'm proposing to fix it with new sysctl or boot flag.
