Thanks for running some tests Jens, unfortunately the git tree hadn't
been updated to reflect the improved audit_uring_entry() and
audit_uring_exit() functions as we were still discussing things and I
thought there still might be some changes.  I just now updated the
branch with the latest code so if you have the cycles (ha!) to run
another perf test I think those numbers would be more interesting.
For example, I don't believe you should see __audit_uring_entry() or
__audit_uring_exit() at all if you have the audit "task,never" rule
loaded; you will see audit_uring_entry() and audit_uring_exit() but as
we discussed previously those should just be a single
"current->audit_context != NULL" check.

Also, I want to pull back a bit as I think there is confusion about
how audit works and why these changes are necessary.  As everyone
likely knows, there are audit calls sprinkled throughout the kernel
code, e.g. audit_log_format() and similar.  In addition to these calls
that most are aware of, there are setup/teardown audit calls that run
at task creation and destruction as well as at syscall entry and exit.
It is these lesser known calls that are responsible for the filtering,
setup, and general management of the audit context state in the
system; they also handle generation of some audit records such as
SYSCALL, PATH, etc. based on information that is recorded by audit
calls inserted into other places in the kernel.  The
audit_alloc_kernel() and audit_free() calls we are adding to the
io_uring/io-wq code are intended to do similar things to the existing
audit task creation/destruction hooks, but for the io_uring/io-wq
kernel threads.  Similarly the audit_uring_entry() and
audit_uring_exit() calls are intended to act as replacements for the
syscall entry and exit code.  If we want the existing audit calls in
the kernel to work properly, we need these setup/teardown functions.

Hopefully that makes things a bit more clear regarding these calls in
the io_uring/io-wq code.

Another point I wanted to address is the "double audit" (!!!) that has
been mentioned recently in this thread.  Don't get too excited, this
isn't quite what you think it is, it is a side effect of how io_uring
can dispatch certain operations.  As I think the io_uring folks
already know, io_uring can process I/O ops in several different
contexts; one of which is after a syscall completes but before the
kernel returns to userspace.  In this particular case things can get
rather interesting from an audit perspective as we need to handle both
the syscall audit records *and* the io_uring operation records.  If
you look closer at the audit code in this patchset you'll see some of
the fun stuff we need to do to make sure this case is handled
correctly.  If you happen to see a code path that takes you through
audit_syscall_entry() + <syscall_stuff> + audit_uring_entry() +
<io_uring_stuff> + audit_uring_exit() + audit_syscall_exit() rest
assured that is correct :)

Of course there is the normal audit_uring_entry() and
audit_uring_exit() without the audit syscall hooks in other code
paths, e.g. SQPOLL, but those are less dramatic than the "OMG, double
audit!!!" ;)
