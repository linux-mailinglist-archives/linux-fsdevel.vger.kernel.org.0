This patchset represents a fully-working prototype of fscrypt
integration into cephfs. The main difference from the series I posted
last week is a pile of bugfixes. At this point most of the xfstests that
pass without -o test_dummy_encryption work with it as well, and most of
the "encrypt" group also passes.

The main reason I'm calling this a prototype is because this doesn't yet
support proper integration with fscache. For that, the plan is to
migrate more of the ceph I/O paths to use netfs helpers, and to plumb
the necessary support for fscrypt integration into there.

We could either wait for that support before merging this, or go ahead
and take what we have now and adapt to the netfs helpers later. I'm open
to suggestions here.

Note that this series relies on the sparse read support for the client
that is currently sitting in the "testing" branch in the ceph-client
tree [1].  At this point I'm planning to push this series into the
testing branch as well, so we start getting some testing coverage in
teuthology.

Currently, if you wish to test fscrypt functionality, you will need ceph
built from branch that tracks the master branch. I'm hoping to get one
last required OSD fix in for Quincy, but it may not make GA [2].

Finally, special thanks to Luis and Xiubo, for all of their help with
this, and to Eric Biggers for advice and review. David Howells has also
been instrumental with the netfs work.

We might actually finish this!
