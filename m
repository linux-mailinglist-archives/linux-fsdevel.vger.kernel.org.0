This looks great!

It would be nice to copy these IOCTL descriptions to the user
documentation too. That would help explain the rationale and let users
know that they should not be worried about the related IOCTLs.

What about creating a new helper in fs.c that expands the FS access
rights, something like this:

int landlock_expand_fs_access(access_mask_t *access_mask)
{
	if (!*access_mask)
		return -ENOMSG;

	*access_mask = expand_all_ioctl(*access_mask, *access_mask);
	return 0;
}


And in syscalls.c:

	err =
		landlock_expand_fs_access(&ruleset_attr.handled_access_fs);
	if (err)
		return err;

	/* Checks arguments and transforms to kernel struct. */
	ruleset = landlock_create_ruleset(ruleset_attr.handled_access_fs,
					  ruleset_attr.handled_access_net);


And patch the landlock_create_ruleset() helper with that:

-	if (!fs_access_mask && !net_access_mask)
+	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!fs_access_mask) && !net_access_mask)
		return ERR_PTR(-ENOMSG);

Why not something like LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_GROUP* to highlight that
these are in fact (synthetic) access rights?

I'm not sure we can find better than GROUP because even the content of
these groups might change in the future with new access rights.

Are you suggesting to handle differently this right if it is applied to
a directory?

If the scope of LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL is well documented, that should
be OK. But maybe we should rename this right to something like
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEFAULT to make it more obvious that it handles
IOCTLs that are not handled by other access rights?

I don't see any issue to this approach. If there is no way to handle GFX
in v5, then there is nothing more we can do than allowing GFX (on the
same file). Another way to say it is that in v5 we allow any IOCTL
(including GFX ones) on the GFX files, an in v6 we *need* replace this
IOCTL right with the newly available GFX right, *if it is handled* by
the ruleset.

If GFX would not be tied to a file, I think it would not be a good
design for this access right. Currently all access rights are tied to
objects/data, or relative to the sandbox (e.g. ptrace).
