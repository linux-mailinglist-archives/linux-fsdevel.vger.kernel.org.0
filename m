Well, I don't remember the details but I think there were issues when
remount between ro/rw state raced with ext4 error setting the filesystem
read-only. ext4_remount() isn't really prepared for SB_RDONLY changing
under it and VFS could possibly get confused as well. Also if nothing else
the unlocked update (or the properly locked one!) to sb->s_flags can get
lost due to a racing read-modify-write cycle of sb->s_flags from other
process.

All these could possibly be fixed but in general it is a rather fragile
design that the SB_RDONLY flag can change under you at any moment.
Basically two following sb_rdonly() checks have to be prepared to get
different results regardless of locks they hold. And this is very easy to
forget. So I still think moving away from that is a good direction.

Ah, I see. I didn't think about that. Is it that you really want reading to
work from a filesystem after error? Can you share why (I'm just trying to
understand the usecase)? Or is this mostly a theoretical usecase?

I think we could introduce "shutdown modifications" state which would still
allow pure reads to succeed if there's a usecase for such functionality.

Yes, I think this would be a good addition regardless of other changes we
might need to do. It would be preferable to be able to come up with
something that's acceptable for querying of shutdown state also for other
filesystems - I've CCed fsdevel and XFS in particular since it has much
longer history of fs shutdown implementation.
