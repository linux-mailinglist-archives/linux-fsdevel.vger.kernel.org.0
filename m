Let's not call this "meta_type". Can we use something that has a less
overloaded meaning, like "sqe_extended_capabilities", or "ecap", or
something like that.

I don't think anything done so far aligns with what Pavel had in mind.
Let me try to lay out what I think he's going for. Just bare with me,
this is just a hypothetical example.

  This patch adds a PI extension.
  Later, let's say write streams needs another extenion.
  Then key per-IO wants another extention.
  Then someone else adds wizbang-awesome-feature extention.

Let's say you have device that can do all 4, or any combination of them.
Pavel wants a solution that is future proof to such a scenario. So not
just a single new "meta_type" with its structure, but a list of types in
no particular order, and their structures.

That list can exist either in the extended SQE, or in some other user
address that the kernel will need copy.
