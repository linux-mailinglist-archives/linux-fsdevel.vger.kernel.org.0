I can't tell without seeing the variant your diff is against, but at a guess
it had a non-trivial amount of trouble with missed rcu_read_unlock() in
cases when path_init() fails after having done rcu_read_lock().  For trivial
testcase, consider passing -1 for dfd, so that it would fail with -EBADF.
Or passing 0 for dfd and "blah" for name (assuming your stdin is not a directory).
Sure, you could handle those in path_init() (or delay grabbing rcu_read_lock()
in there, spreading it in a bunch of branches), but duplicated cleanup logics
for a bunch of failure exits is asking for trouble.
