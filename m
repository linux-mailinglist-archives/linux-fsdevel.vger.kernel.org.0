This is just ugly with questionable value. A constant reminder of how
broken this is. Exposing the subvolume id also makes this somewhat redundant.

Exposing this makes sense. I've mentioned that I'd be open to exporting
the subvolume id in statx before even though I know some people don't
like that. I still stand by that. Especially now that we have btrfs and
bcachefs that both have the concept of a subvolume id it makes sense to
put it into statx().

No, we're should not be reinventing another opaque handle. And even if
it really doesn't belong into statx().

I also would like both btrfs and bcachefs to agree.
