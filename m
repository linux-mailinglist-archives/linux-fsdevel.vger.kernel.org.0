Don't like that either, as it doesn't really change the fact that you're
now doing something very different with the user_data field, which is
just supposed to be passed in/out directly. Adding a random flag to
signal this behavior isn't very explicit either, imho. It's still some
out-of-band (ish) notification of behavior that is different from any
other command. This is very different from having a flag that says
"there's extra information in this other field", which is much cleaner.
