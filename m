Exactly why I asked last time: "who uses it and how do you want them to
use it" :)

So we need a completely different attribute for SCSI's permanent write
streams? You'd mentioned earlier you were okay with having SCSI be able
to utilized per-io raw block write hints. Having multiple things to
check for what are all just write classifiers seems unnecessarily
complicated.

No need to create a new fcntl. The people already testing this are
successfully using FDP with the existing fcntl hints. Their applications
leverage FDP as way to separate files based on expected lifetime. It is
how they want to use it and it is working above expectations.

That's fine. This patch series pretty much accomplishes that part.
