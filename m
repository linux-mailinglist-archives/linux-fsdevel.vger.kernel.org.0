An alternate approach would be to allow the writeback through a
delegation to skip the mtime/ctime update, possibly making use of
FMODE_NOCMTIME.

It would be nice to have some mechanism in the VFS to ensure there was
an ATTR_CTIME_SET request on any file which had made use of
FMODE_NOCMTIME before that file was closed, else the times would be set
to the time of the close.  That wouldn't be entirely straight forward,
but should be manageable.  (I would allow some way to avoid the ctime
update on close so XFS_IOC_OPENBY_HANDLE could still be supported, but
it would need to be explicit somewhere).

While FMODE_NOCMTIME also distorts the meaning of ctime, I think it is
better than making it too easy for ctime to go backwards.

How would you feel about that approach?

I think that splitting the client from the server is a non-trivial task
that brings no benefit to anyone.  Any chance I get I advocate
upstreaming both at once.
