As far as I'm concerned filesystems with on-disk format will not be made
mountable by unprivileged containers. And I don't think I'm alone in
that view. The idea that ever more parts of the kernel with a massive
attack surface such as a filesystem need to vouchesafe for the safety in
the face of every rando having access to
unshare --mount --user --map-root is a dead end and will just end up
trapping us in a neverending cycle of security bugs (Because every
single bug that's found after making that fs mountable from an
unprivileged container will be treated as a security bug no matter if
justified or not. So this is also a good way to ruin your filesystem's
reputation.).

And honestly, if we set the precedent that it's fine for one filesystem
with an on-disk format to be able to be mounted by unprivileged
containers then other filesystems eventually want to do this as well.

At the rate we currently add filesystems that's just a matter of time
even if none of the existing ones would also want to do it. And then
we're left arguing that this was just an exception for one super
special, super safe, unexploitable filesystem with an on-disk format.

Imho, none of this is appealing. I don't want to slowly keep building a
future where we end up running fuzzers in unprivileged container to
generate random images to crash the kernel.

I have more arguments why I don't think is a path we will ever go down
but I don't want this to detract from the legitimate ask of making it
possible to mount trusted images from within unprivileged containers.
Because I think that's perfectly legitimate.

However, I don't think that this is something the kernel needs to solve
other than providing the necessary infrastructure so that this can be
solved in userspace.

Off-list, Amir had pointed to a blog I wrote last week (cf. [1]) where I
explained how we currently mount into mount namespaces of unprivileged
cotainers which had been quite a difficult problem before the new mount
api. But now it's become almost comically trivial. I mean, there's stuff
that will still be good to have but overall all the bits are already
there.

Imho, delegated mounting should be done by a system service that is
responsible for all the steps that require privileges. So for most
filesytems not mountable by unprivileged user this would amount to:

fd_fs = fsopen("xfs")
fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "source", "/sm/sm")
fsconfig(FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE)
fd_mnt = fsmount(fd_fs)
// Only required for attributes that require privileges against the sb
// of the filesystem such as idmapped mounts
mount_setattr(fd_mnt, ...)

and then the fd_mnt can be sent to the container which can then attach
it wherever it wants to. The system level service doesn't even need to
change namespaces via setns(fd_userns|fd_mntns) like I illustrated in
the post I did. It's sufficient if we sent it via AF_UNIX for example
that's exposed to the container.

Of course, this system level service would be integrated with mount(8)
directly over a well-defined protocol. And this would be nestable as
well by e.g., bind-mounting the AF_UNIX socket.

And we do already support a rudimentary form of such integration through
systemd. For example via mount -t ddi (cf. [2]) which makes it possible
to mount discoverable disk images (ddi). But that's just an
illustration. 

This should be integrated with mount(8) and should be a simply protocol
over varlink or another lightweight ipc mechanism that can be
implemented by systemd-mountd (which is how I coined this for lack of
imagination when I came up with this) or by some other component if
platforms like k8s really want to do their own thing.

This also allows us to extend this feature to the whole system btw and
to all filesystems at once. Because it means that if systemd-mountd is
told what images to trust (based on location, from a specific registry,
signature, or whatever) then this isn't just useful for unprivileged
containers but also for regular users on the host that want to mount
stuff.

This is what we're currently working on.

(There's stuff that we can do to make this more powerful __if__ we need
to. One example would probably that we _could_ make it possible to mark
a superblock as being owned by a specific namespace with similar
permission checks as what we currently do for idmapped mounts
(privileged in the superblock of the fs, privileged over the ns to
delegate to etc). IOW,

fd_fs = fsopen("xfs")
fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "source", "/sm/sm")
fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_FD, "owner", fd_container_userns)

which completely sidesteps the issue of making that on-disk filesystem
mountable by unpriv users.

But let me say that this is completely unnecessary today as you can do:

fd_fs = fsopen("xfs")
fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "source", "/sm/sm")
fsconfig(FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE)
fd_mnt = fsmount(fd_fs)
mount_setattr(fd_mnt, MOUNT_ATTR_IDMAP)

which changes ownership across the whole filesystem. The only time you
really want what I mention here is if you want to delegate control over
__every single ioctl and potentially destructive operation associated
with that filesystem__ to an unprivileged container which is almost
never what you want.)
