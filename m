I think the better question is what harm does it do?  Yes, I'm not
aware of an auditd implementation that currently makes use of
io_uring, but it is also not inconceivable some future implementation
might want to make use of it and given the disjoint nature of kernel
and userspace development I don't want the kernel to block such
developments.  However, if you can think of a reason why having this
check here is bad I'm listening (note: we are already in the slow path
here so having the additional check isn't an issue as far as I'm
concerned).

As a reminder, auditd_test_task() only returns true/1 if the task is
registered with the audit subsystem as an auditd connection, an
auditctl process should not cause this function to return true.

FWIW, my intention was to treat io_uring opcodes exactly like we treat
syscall numbers.  Yes, this would potentially be an issue if we wanted
to combine syscalls and io_uring opcodes into one filter, but why
would we ever want to do that?  Combining the two into one filter not
only makes the filter lists longer than needed (we will always know if
we are filtering on a syscall or io_uring op) and complicates the
filter rule processing.

Or is there a problem with this that I'm missing?

I've never been a fan of audit's "perm" filtering; I've always felt
there were better ways to handle that so I'm not overly upset that we
are skipping that functionality with this initial support.  If it
becomes a problem in the future we can always add that support at a
later date.

I currently fear that just getting io_uring and audit to coexist is
going to be a large enough problem in the immediate future.

Great, thank you.  I haven't grabbed a copy yet for testing, but I will.

See my comments above, I don't currently see why we would ever want
syscall and io_uring filtering to happen in the same rule.  Please
speak up if you can think of a reason why this would either be needed,
or desirable for some reason.

I'm going to be honest with you and simply say that I've run out of my
email/review time in front of the computer on this holiday weekend
(blame the lockdown/bpf/lsm discussion <g>) and I need to go for
today, but this is something I'll take a look it this coming week.
Hopefully the comments above give us something to think/talk about in
the meantime.

Regardless, thanks for your help on the userspace side of the
filtering, that should make testing a lot easier moving forward.
