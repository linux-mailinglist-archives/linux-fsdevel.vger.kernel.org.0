No, we don't map data directly to zones using lifetime hints. In fact,
lifetime hints contribute only a
relatively small part  (~10% extra write amp reduction, see the
rocksdb benchmark results).
Segregating data by file is the most important part of the data
placement heuristic, at least
for this type of workload.

Yes, but while FDP support could be improved later on(happy to help if
that'll be the case),
I'm just afraid that less work now defining the way data placement is
exposed is going to
result in a bigger mess later when more use cases will be considered.
