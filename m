It's very heavily used by dbus-broker, polkit and systemd to safely
authenticate clients instead of by PIDs. (Fyi, it's even supported for
bluetooth sockets so they could benefit from this as well I'm sure.)

I think that was already possible because you could send pidfds via
SCM_RIGHTS. That's a lot more cooperative than SO_PEERPIDFD of course
but still.

But if that's an issue we could of course enforce that pidfd_getfd() may
only work if the target is within your pidns hierarchy just as we do for
the PIDFD_GET_INFO ioctl() already. But I'm not sure it's an issue.
