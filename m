It looks like it would need to be:

static bool dump_interrupted(void)
{
	return fatal_signal_pending() || freezing();
}

As the original implementation of dump_interrupted 528f827ee0bb
("coredump: introduce dump_interrupted()") is deliberately allowing the
freezer to terminate the core dumps to allow for reliable system
suspend.
