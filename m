Hi Martin,

This patch series should make it easier to implement I/O hint support
since some of the code added by this patch series is also needed to
implement I/O hint support.

Hmm ... isn't that exactly what T10 did, define everything in the IO
advice hints group descriptor by introducing the new ST_ENBLE bit in
that descriptor?

This patch series relies on the constrained streams mechanism. A
constrained stream is permanently open. The new ST_ENBLE bit in the IO
advice hints group descriptor indicates whether or not an IO advice
hints group represents a permanent stream.

The new ST_ENBLE bit in the IO advice hints group descriptor allows SCSI
devices to interpret the index of the descriptor as a data lifetime.
 From the approved T10 proposal:

Table x1 â€“ RELATIVE LIFETIME field
..............................................
Code        Relative lifetime
..............................................
00h         no relative lifetime is applicable
01h         shortest relative lifetime
02h         second shortest relative lifetime
03h to 3Dh  intermediate relative lifetimes
3Eh         second longest relative lifetime
3Fh         longest relative lifetime
..............................................

We plan to ask UFS device vendors to modify the UFS device firmware and
to add support for the VPD and mode pages this patch series relies on.
My understanding is that this can be done easily in UFS device firmware.

Although it is technically possible to update the firmware of UFS
devices in smartphones, most smartphones do not support this because
this is considered risky. Hence, only new smartphones will benefit from
this patch series.

I do not want to add support in the Linux kernel for how conventional
UFS devices use the GROUP NUMBER field today. Conventional UFS devices
interpret the GROUP NUMBER field as a "ContextID". The ContextID
mechanism has a state, just like the SCSI stream mechanism. UFS contexts
need to be opened explicitly and are closed upon reset. From the UFS 4.0
specification: "No ContextID shall be open after power cycle."

Please let me know if you need more information.

Bart.
