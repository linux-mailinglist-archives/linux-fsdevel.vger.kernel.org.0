I suddenly understand what you mean, you mean that now dqput() doesn't have
any possible sleep operation. So it can be called in spin_lock at will.

I was confused because I understood that dqput() cannot be called in the 
context
of possible sleep.

Now there is only the problem in patch 5.

Thanks!
