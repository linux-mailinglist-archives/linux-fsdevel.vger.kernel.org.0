That's exactly the case here. It should *never* happen in normal
production workloads, and it if does then we have the *potential*
for silent data loss occurring. That's *exactly* the sort of thing
we should be warning admins about in no uncertain terms.  Also, we
use WARN_ON_ONCE(), so it's not going to spam the logs.

syzbot is a malicious program - it is injecting broken stuff into
the kernel as root to try to trigger situations like this. That
doesn't make a warning it triggers bad or incorrect - syzbot is
pertubing tightly coupled structures in a way that makes the
information shared across those structures inconsistent and
eventually the code is going to trip over that inconsistency.

IOWs, once someone has used root permissions to mount a maliciously
crafted filesystem image, *all bets are off*. The machine is running
a potentially compromised kernel at this point. Hence it is almost
guaranteed that at some point the kernel is going to discover things
are *badly wrong* and start dumping "this should never happen!"
warnings into the logs. That's what the warnings are supposed to do,
and the fact that syzbot can trigger them doesn't make the warnings
wrong.

It is worth remembering that those are guidelines, not enforcable
rules and any experienced kernel developer will tell you the same
thing.  We know the guidelines, we know when to apply them, we know
there are cases that the guidelines simply can't, don't or won't
cover.
