I'll have a look at what I needed when I was working to implement

this in systemd. Without looking at the code I can say I was

handling mount, umount and I think remount events so that's probably

a minimum.


As I mentioned earlier I found I also need event rate management

which was a new requirement at the time.

I would like to help with this but I'm not familiar with fanotify

so I'll need to spend a bit of time on that. I am just about in

a position to do that now.


I'll also be looking at the watch queue framework that did get merged

back then, I'm not sure how that will turn out.

Yes that will be an interesting question, I have noticed Christians'

work on mount beneath.


We need to provide the ability to monitor mount tables as is done by

using the proc mount lists to start with and I'm pretty sure that

includes at least mount, umount and moves perhaps more but I'll check

what I was using.

Also an interesting question, we will see in time I guess.


You would think that the mount/umount/move events would get what's

needed because (assuming mount move maps to remount) mount, umount

and remount should cover cases were mounted mount attributes change.

Monitoring the proc mount tables essentially provides lists of mounts

that are present in a mount namespace (as seen by the given process)

so this is going to be needed sooner rather than later if we hope to

realize improvements from our new system calls.
