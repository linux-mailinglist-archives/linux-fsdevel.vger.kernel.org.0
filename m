Heh.  For reproducibility, I wonder if it ought to be a good idea for
the commit messages to contain the prompts fed to the LLM?  Maybe I'll
suggest that to Sasha.

Oh, I was hoping you'd say that you reprompted all the way to working
patches, but I suppose AIs are rather expensive to operate.

ha lol :)

<nod> I think Miklos mentioned that I could work around that by allowing
fuse servers to set the root nodeid with a mount option.

Well we could just do the usual "make main exit(1) for the duration of
the chur^Wchanges" trick to avoid bisection bombs. :)

Yeah.  Though first I need to lay the groundwork by figuring out if
macfuse/freebsd fuse actually provide the lowlevel library.  If not,
then per Ted's direction I'll have to implement both. :/

Maybe I'll try the Oracle codebot this week, though I think they said it
only knows Python.  Anyway, thanks for the inputs. :)
