I think I would prefer to have them as part of xfstests:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfstests-dev.git

as that's where nearly all of the fs testing is taking place. It's never
great when developers have to run 3 separate testsuites to get
meaningful coverage. So having it central to xfstests would be my
preference.

A while ago I added a testsuite that tests generic core VFS behavior
it's located under src/vfs:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfstests-dev.git/tree/src/vfs

and covers a lot of different things. So I would ask you to consider
adding a new testsuite into that file:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfstests-dev.git/tree/src/vfs/vfstest.c

I think the structure should be somewhat understandable. Then create a
new test in xfstests using the "new" helper in the generic sectionA

> ./new generic
Next test id is 728
Append a name to the ID? Test name will be 728-$name. y,[n]:
Creating test file '728'
Add to group(s) [auto] (separate by space, ? for list): auto quick
Creating skeletal script for you to edit ...

then call the vfstest binary from the generated test case:

echo "Silence is golden"

$here/src/vfs/vfstest --test-THAT-NEW-SWITCH-NAME-YOU-ADDED --device "$TEST_DEV" \
        --mount "$TEST_DIR" --fstype "$FSTYP"

status=$?
exit

(You can also submit this to LTP or tell them about this change and
they'll likely add tests in addition to xfstests.)

Forgive me for being lazy and instead of repeating everything I'll just
