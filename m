But that's pretty irrelevant.  The scatterlists that block has been
constructing to drive DMA engines pre-date SCSI's addition of SGLs by
decades (all SCSI commands before the object commands use a linear
buffer which is implemented in the HBA engine as a scatterlist but not
described by the SCSI standard as one).

So the answer to the question should the block layer emit zero length
sgl elements is "no" because they can confuse some DMA engines.

If there's a more theoretical question of whether the target driver in
adding commands it doesn't yet support should inject zero length SGL
elements into block because SCSI allows it, the answer is still "no"
because we don't want block to have SGLs that may confuse other DMA
engines.  There's lots of daft corner cases in the SCSI standard we
don't implement and a nop for SGL elements seems to be one of the more
hare brained because it adds no useful feature and merely causes
compatibility issues.
