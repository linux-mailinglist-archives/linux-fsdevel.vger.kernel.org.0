No, you are wrong. The logic works as I described it.

No that is incorrect. If you disregard SQPOLL, then the 'mm' is always
who submitted it.

Also doesn't seem like a problem, if you understand the 'mm' logic
above. Unless SQPOLL is used, the entering tasks mm will be used.
There's no mixing of tasks and mm outside of that.
