I don't agree. It's changes all across the vfs but it's not hacky in any
way since it cleanly passes down an additional argument (I'm biased of
course.).

Thanks for this interesting idea! I have some troubles with it though.

This approach (always) seemed conceptually wrong to me. Like Tycho said
somewhere else this basically would act like a global variable which
isn't great.

There's also a substantial difference between in that the current fsuid
and fsgid are an actual property of the callers creds so to have them in
there makes perfect sense. But the user namespace of the vfsmount is a
property of the mount and as such glueing it to the callers creds when
calling into the vfs is just weird and I would very much like to avoid
this. If inode's wouldn't have an i_sb member we wouldn't suddenly start
to pass down the s_user_ns via the callers creds to the filesystems.

I'm also not fond of having to call prepare_creds() and override_creds()
all across the vfs. It's messy and prepare_creds() is especially
problematic during RCU pathwalk where we can't call it. We could
in path_init() at the start of every every lookup operation call
prepare_creds() and then override them when we need to switch the
fs_userns global variable and then put_creds() at the end of every path
walk in terminate_walk(). But this means penalizing every lookup
operations with an additional prepare_creds() which needs to be called
at least once, I think. Then during lookup we would need to
override/change this new global fs_userns variable potentially at each
mountpoint crossing to switch back to the correct fs_userns for idmapped
and non-idmapped mounts. We'd also need to rearrange a bunch of
terminate_walk() calls and we would like end up with a comparable amount
of changes only that they would indeed be more messy since we're
strapping fs_userns to the caller's creds.

I an alternative might be to have a combined approach where you pass the
user namespace around in the vfs but when calling into the filesystem
use the fs_userns global variable approach but I would very much prefer
to avoid this and instead cleanly pass down the user namespace
correctly. That's more work, it'll take longer but I and others are
around to see these changes through.

That seems like a problem that can be handled by simply keeping the
userns around similar to how we need to already keep creds around.
