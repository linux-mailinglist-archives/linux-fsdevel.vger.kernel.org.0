I'm thoroughly confused how this would be a meaningful April fools joke?

The comments in that file are literally 20+ years old and no one has
ever bothered to add new updates there even though Al, Neil, Jeff,
myself and a lot of others probably rewrote that file a gazillion number
of times together or significantly or at least subtly changed the rules.

So should we have added comments to the top of the file each time?
And since we didn't does it really serve as an interesting historical log?

The proper place for that has been
Documentation/filesystems/{locking.rst,porting.rst,path_lookup.rst}
for a long time now.

The comments are historical artifacts. At best they serve as a
humble-brag about who massaged what. I venture a guess and think that no
one needs that comment to figure out who has made a significant impact
here.
