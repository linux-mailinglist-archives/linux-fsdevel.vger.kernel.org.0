Your kernel (4.14.170) was released on 5 Feb 2020, and so it won't
contain any of the above commits. The xattr -id code in 4.14.170,
was last updated in May 2011, and so it is much more likely the
problem is elsewhere.

The xattr id index table is written to the end of the Squashfs filesystem,
and it is the first table read on mounting.

As such this is the error you will receive if the Squashfs filesystem
has been truncated in some way. This is by far the most likely reason
for the error.

So you need to check if the Squashfs filesystem image is truncated or
corrupted in some way. This could obviously have happened before
writing to the flash, during writing or afterwards. It could also be
being truncated at read time. The cause could be faulty hardware or
software at any point in the I/O path, at any point in the processs.

So, you need to double check everything at each of the above stages.

1. Check the Squashfs filesystem for correctness before writing it to
the flash. You can run Unsquashfs on the image and see if it reports
any errors.

2. You need to check the filesystem for integrity after writing it to
the flash. Compute a checksum, and compare it with the original
checksum.

In that way you can pinpoint the cause of the truncation/corruption.
But, this is unlikely to be a Squashfs issue, and more likely
truncation/corruption caused by something else.
