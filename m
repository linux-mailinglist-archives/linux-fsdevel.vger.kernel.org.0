This is exciting, we have been looking in the same area recently.  Adding

In your diffstat, one thing I notice that is omitted: an update to 
Documentation/* :)  Any chance of getting some proposed Documentation/ 
updates with structure of the fs, the per subsystem breakdown, and best 
practices for managing the stats from the kernel level?

This seems like it could have a lot of overhead if we wanted to 
periodically track the totality of subsystem stats as a form of telemetry 
gathering from userspace.  To collect telemetry for 1,000 different stats, 
do we need to issue lseek()+read() syscalls for each of them individually 
(or, worse, open()+read()+close())?

Any thoughts on how that can be optimized?  A couple of ideas:

 - an interface that allows gathering of all stats for a particular
   interface through a single file that would likely be encoded in binary
   and the responsibility of userspace to disseminate, or

 - an interface that extends beyond this proposal and allows the reader to
   specify which stats they are interested in collecting and then the
   kernel will only provide these stats in a well formed structure and 
   also be binary encoded.

We've found that the one-file-per-stat method is pretty much a show 
stopper from the performance view and we always must execute at least two 
syscalls to obtain a single stat.

Since this is becoming a generic API (good!!), maybe we can discuss 
possible ways to optimize gathering of stats in mass?
