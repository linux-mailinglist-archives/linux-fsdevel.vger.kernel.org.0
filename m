Mount trees can get pretty massive due to containers and mount
propagation. That's why propagate_umount() is so ugly because it's
optimized to deal with such cases.

But, I think that recursive watches have to be restricted to mount
namespaces anyway. Such that you can get notifications about all mount
and umounts in a specific mount namespace. That reigns in the problem
quite a bit.

Yes, that's what I've been arguing for at LSFMM.
