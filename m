I have not seen a report other than the crun fix I commented on.

The crun authors had agreed to fix this in crun. As symlink mode changes
are severly broken to the point that it's not even supported through the
official glibc and musl system call wrappers anymore not having to
revert this from mainline would be the ideal outcome.

So ideally, the crun bugfix would be backported to Debian stable just as
it was already backported to Fedora or crun make a new point release for
the 1.8.* series.

The other option to consider would be to revert the backport of the attr
changes to stable kernels. I'm not sure what Greg's stance on this is
but given that crun versions in -testing already include that fix that
means all future Debian releases will already have a fixed crun version.

That symlink stuff is so brittle and broken that we'd do more long-term
harm by letting it go on. Which is why we did this.

@Linus, this is ultimately your call of course.
