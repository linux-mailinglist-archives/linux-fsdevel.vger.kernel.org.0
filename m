My intuition is not to do this kind of creative reinterpretation of
return values. Instead let=E2=80=99s have a new type of seccomp filter
specifically for io_uring. So we can have SECCOMP_IO_URING_ACCEPT,
ERRNO, and eventually other things. We probably will want a user
notifier feature for io_uring, but I'd be a bit surprised if it ends
up ABI-compatible with current users of user notifiers.

Agreed.

As above, I think this should be intercepted by seccomp, but in a new
mode.  I think that existing seccomp filters should not intercept it.

Agreed.

Let's ignore personalities for a moment (and see below).  Thinking
through the possibilities:

A: io_uring seccomp filters are attached to tasks.  When an io_uring
is created, it inherits an immutable copy of its creating task's
filter, and that's the filter set that applies to that io_uring
instance.  This could have somewhat bizarre consequences if the fd
gets passed around, but io_uring already has odd security effects if
fds are passed around.  It has the annoying property that, if a
library creates an io_uring and then a seccomp filter is loaded, the
io_uring bypasses the library.

B: The same, but the io_uring references the creating task so new
filters on the task apply to the io_uring, too.  This allows loading
and then sandboxing.  Is this too bizarre overall?

C: io_uring filters are attached directly to io_urings.  This has the
problem where an io_uring created before a task sandboxes itself isn't
sandboxed.  It also would require that a filter be able to hook
io_uring creation to sandbox it.

Does anyone actually pass io_urings around with SCM_RIGHTS?  It would
be really nice if we could make the default be that io_urings are
bound to their creating mm and can't be used outside it.  Then
creating an mm-crossing io_uring could, itself, be restricted.

In any case, my inclination is to go for choice B.  Choice C could
also be supported if there's a use case.
