AIUI, the memory allocation looping has back-offs already built in
to it when memory reserves are exhausted and/or reclaim is
congested.

e.g:

get_page_from_freelist()
  (zone below watermark)
  node_reclaim()
    __node_reclaim()
      shrink_node()
        reclaim_throttle()

And the call to recalim_throttle() will do the equivalent of
memalloc_retry_wait() (a 2ms sleep).

If userspace uses all of memory all the time, then the best the
kernel can do is slowly limp along. Preventing userspace from
overcommitting memory to the point of OOM is the only way to avoid
these "userspace space wants more memory than the machine physically
has" sorts of issues. i.e. this is not a problem that the kernel
code can solve short of randomly killing userspace applications...
