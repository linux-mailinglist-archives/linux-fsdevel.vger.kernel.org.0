You're lending strong support for my earlier point. Because this is a
clear an example where a subsystem got access to a helper that it
shouldn't have had access to. So we fixed the issue.

But this whole polemic just illustrates that you simply didn't bother to
understand how the code works. The way you talk about UAF together with
SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU is telling. Please read the code instead of
guessing.

So the same way we don't have to take responsibility for bpf
misunderstanding the expectations of d_path() we don't have to take
responsibility for misusing an internal helper by another subsystem.

So your argument here is moot at best and polemical and opportunistic at
worst. It certainly doesn't illustrate what you think it does.

And the above is fundamentally a suspiciously long sideshow. So let's
get back to the core topic: Unless you document your rules when it's ok
for a bpf program to come along and request access to internal apis
patchsets such as this are not acceptable.

Uhm, no it was always sketchy.

The fix is to export a variant with trusted args.

I will remind you of what you have been told in [1]:

"No. It's not up to maintainers to suggest alternatives. Sometimes it's
simply enough to explain *why* something isn't acceptable.

A plain "no" without explanation isn't sufficient. NAKs need a good
reason. But they don't need more than that.

The onus of coming up with an acceptable solution is on the person who
needs something new."

You've been provided:

a) good reasons why the patchset in it's current form isn't acceptable
   repeated multiple times
b) support for exporting a variant of bpf_d_path() that is safe to use
c) a request that all kfunc exports for the vfs will have to be located
   under fs/, not in kernel/bpf/
d) a path on how to move forward with additional kfunc requests:
   Clear and documented rules when it's ok for someone to come along and
   request access to bpf kfuncs when it's to be rejected and when it's
   ok to be supported.

You repeatedly threatening to go over the heads of people will not make
them more amenable to happily integrate with your subsystem.
