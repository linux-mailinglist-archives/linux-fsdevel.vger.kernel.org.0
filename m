This should have a "Co-developed-by: Mike..." tag, since you're making
changes and not just passing it along directly.

I'd love to make /proc/$pid/mem more strict. A few comments:

> [...]

It really looks like you're trying to do a form of ptrace_may_access(),
but _without_ the introspection exception?

Also, using "current" in the write path can lead to problems[1], so this
should somehow use file->f_cred, or limit write access during the open()
instead?

Instead of a build-time CONFIG, I'd prefer a boot-time config (or a
sysctl, but that's be harder given the perms). That this is selectable
by distro users, etc, and they don't need to rebuild their kernel to
benefit from it.

Jann Horn has tried to restrict access to this file in the past as well,
so he may have some additional advice about it.
