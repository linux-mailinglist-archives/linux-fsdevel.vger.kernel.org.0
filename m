Found it but struct io_uring missing "features" in everything except
rawhide.  Forced upgrade of my test VMs.  :-)

audit-testsuite still passes.

I'm getting:
	# ./iouring.2                                                
	Kernel thread io_uring-sq is not running.                                      
	Unable to setup io_uring: Permission denied

	# ./iouring.3s
	>>> server started, pid = 2082                                                 
	>>> memfd created, fd = 3                                                      
	io_uring_queue_init: Permission denied

I have CONFIG_IO_URING=y set, what else is needed?
