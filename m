Hi Luis and Julia,

(Julia, there is a question and context for you inline, marked with your name)

I used the following coccinelle script to find more handlers that I
missed before:

virtual patch
virtual context
virtual report

@@
identifier func;
identifier ctl;
identifier write;
identifier buffer;
identifier lenp;
identifier ppos;
type loff_t;
@@

int func(
- struct ctl_table *ctl,
+ const struct ctl_table *ctl,
  int write, void *buffer, size_t *lenp, loff_t *ppos) { ... }

It did not find any additional occurrences while it was able to match
the existing changes.

After that I manually reviewed all handlers that they are not modifying
their table argument, which they don't.

Should we do more?


For Julia:

Maybe you could advise on how to use coccinelle to find where a const
function argument or one of its members are modified directly or passed
to some other function as non-const arguments.
See the coccinelle patch above.

Is this possible?

As for smatch:

Doesn't smatch itself run as part of a normal build [0]?
So it would have the same visibility issues as the compiler itself.

I'd like to split the series and submit the part up until and including
the constification of arguments first and on its own.
It keeps the subsystem maintainers out of the discussion of the core
sysctl changes.

I'll submit the core sysctl changes after I figure out proper responses
to all review comments and we can do this in parallel to the tree-wide
preparation.

What do you think Luis and Joel?
