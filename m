Right, it's meant to span wider than just block devices.

It's actually 48 bytes in the as-posted version, and I've bumped it to
56 bytes in the latest branch. So not quite enough for everything,
nothing ever will be, but should work for a lot of cases without
requiring per-command allocations just for the actual command.

Sure, go ahead. Just beware that things are still changing, so you might
have to adapt it a few times. It's still early days, but I do think
that's the way forward in providing controlled access to what is
basically async ioctls.
