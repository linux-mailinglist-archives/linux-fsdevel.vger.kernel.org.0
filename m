User space cares what they refer to.
Unix made integer FD into broken abstraction.
regular files need one set of syscalls to work with such 'integer FDs'.
sockets need another set of syscalls.
All other anon-inodes need another set of syscalls.
While user space sees an integer without type and that a root cause of the bugs.
And that's particularly bad for integers 0,1,2 where user space assumes that
regular files are behind them.

Imagine C++ project where base class is called 'FD' while children
implement their own access methods that don't overlap with each other.
Now one application passes this 'FD' class to another.
That other app can only do trial and error to figure out what it got.
Any user space developer would reject such class hierarchy design,
but kernel folks are so proud of this broken abstraction.
FDs are not special.. POSIX is the standard... Right.
That's why user space keeps their workarounds, because kernel folks
are not empathic to user space needs.
