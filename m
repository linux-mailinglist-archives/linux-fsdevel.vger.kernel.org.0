Jens, it seems that during this rebase you've accidentally squashed the
"fs: update do_*() helpers to return ints" and
"io_uring: add support for IORING_OP_SYMLINKAT" commits, so there is only the
former one in your tree, but it actually adds the SYMLINKAT opcode to io uring
(in addition to changing the helpers return types).
