Initial reply to both Amir and Miklos. Sorry for the delay - I took a few
days off after LSFMM and I'm just re-engaging now.

First an observation: these messages are on the famfs v1 patch set thread.
The v2 patch set is at [1]. That is also the default branch now if you clone
the famfs kernel from [2].

Among the biggest changes at v2 is dropping /dev/pmem support and only 
supporting /dev/dax (character) devices as backing devs for famfs.

I'm happy to help with that if you care - ping me if so; getting a VM running 
in EFI mode is not necessary if you reserve the dax memory via memmap=, or
via libvirt xml.

More generally, a famfs file extent is [daxdev, offset, len]; there may
be multiple extents per file, and in the future this definitely needs to
generalize to multiple daxdev's.

Disclaimer: I'm still coming up to speed on fuse (slowly and ignorantly, 
I think)...

A single backing device (daxdev) will contain extents of many famfs
files (plus metadata - currently a superblock and a log). I'm not sure
it's realistic to have a backing daxdev "open" per famfs file. 

In addition there is:

- struct dax_holder_operations - to allow a notify_failure() upcall
  from dax. This provides the critical capability to shut down famfs
  if there are memory errors. This is filesystem- (or technically daxdev-
  wide)

- The pmem or devdax iomap_ops - to allow the fsdax file system (famfs,
  and [soon] famfs_fuse) to call dax_iomap_rw() and dax_iomap_fault().
  I strongly suspect that famfs_fuse can't be correct unless it uses
  this path rather than just the idea of a single backing file.
  This interface explicitly supports files that map to disjoint ranges
  of one or more dax devices.

- the dev_dax_iomap portion of the famfs patchsets adds iomap_ops to
  character devdax.

- Note that dax devices, unlike files, don't support read/write - only
  mmap(). I suspect (though I'm still pretty ignorant) that this means
  we can't just treat the dax device as an extent-based backing file.

A dax device to famfs is a lot more like a backing device for a "filesystem"
than a backing file for another file. And, as previously mentioned, there
is the iomap_ops interface and the holder_ops interface that deal with
multiple file tenants on a dax device (plus error notification, 
respectively)

Probably doable, but important distinctions...

I'm certain I will need some help, but I'll try to do my part. 

First question: can you suggest an example fuse file pass-through
file system that I might use as a jumping-off point? Something that
gets the basic pass-through capability from which to start hacking
in famfs/dax capabilities?

When I started on famfs, I used ramfs because it got me all the basic
file system functionality minus a backing store. Then I built the dax
functionality by referring to xfs.

I'm confused by the last item. I would think there would be a fuse
inode per famfs file, and that multiple of those would map to separate
extent lists of one or more backing dax devices.

Or maybe I misunderstand the meaning of "fuse inode". Feel free to
assign reading...
