We have an in-kernel implementation of the canonical decomposition
normalization (NFD) in fs/unicode, which is what we use for f2fs and
ext4.  It is heated argument what is the best form for filesystem usage,
and from what I researched, every proprietary filesystem does a
different (and crazy in their unique way) thing.

For exfat, even though the specification is quite liberal, I think the
reasonable answer is to follow closely whatever behavior the Windows
implementation has, whether it does normalization at all or not. Even if
it is just an in-memory format used internally for lookups, assuming a
different format or treating differently invalid file names can result
in awkward results in a filesystem created on another operating system,
like filename collisions or false misses in lookups.
