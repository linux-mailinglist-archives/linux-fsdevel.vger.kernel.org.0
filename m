In order for that out-of-tree BPF LSM program to get similar guarantees
than an equivalent kernel module we need to export all nine functions
for BPF. Included in that set are functions that aren't currently even
exported to modules.

These exports are specifically for an out-of-tree BPF LSM program that
is not accessible to the public. The question in the other mail stands.

Yeah, we'd need specific helpers for a never seen before out-of-tree BPF
LSM. I don't see how that's different from an out-of-tree kernel module.

Oh, good spot. That's an accident. get_file_rcu() definitely shouldn't
be exported. So that'll be removed asap.

I understand your concern but I'm neither irritated by bpf nor do I hold
grudges. As I'm writing this bpf's bpffs and token changes are on their
way into mainline for v6.9 which I reviewed and acked immediately after
that discussion.

Rest assures that you can move on from that concern. There's no need to
keep bringing it up in unrelated discussions.
