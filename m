That is actually an improvement over my patch, I can add this in as 
well. Will also change to FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE and update the patch to 
set it the flag in fuse_file_mmap.

First need to investigate why a loop of generic/095 triggers a locking 
issue, probably something wrong with my latest patch version.

Yeah and better to improve things (and add more complexity) when someone 
has a real live workload.
