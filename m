You shouldn't be able to do that as the code that would be calling
misc_deregister() (i.e. in a module unload path) would not work because
the module reference count is incremented at this point in time due to
the file operation module reference.

Wait, we are plumbing in the module owner logic here, right?  That
should be in the file operations structure.

Yeah, it's a horrid hack, and one day we will put "real" revoke logic in
here to detach the misc device from the file operations if this were to
happen.  It's a very very common anti-pattern that many subsystems have
that is a bug that we all have been talking about for a very very long
time.  Wolfram even has a plan for how to fix it all up (see his Japan
LinuxCon talk from 2 years ago), but I don't think anyone is doing the
work on it :(

The media and drm layers have internal hacks/work-arounds to try to
handle this issue, but luckily for us, the odds of a misc device being
dynamically removed from the system is pretty low.

Once / if ever, we get the revoke type logic implemented, then we can
apply that to the misc device code and follow it through to the rust
side if needed.

Ok, that's fine, I didn't remember either.

So where else is this type enforced?  A read/write/ioctl call also wants
this pointer, or is it up to the open call to stash it somewhere that
those calls can get to it?  It's hanging off of the file pointer now:

So any place that casts back from that structure needs to get this
correct.  Is that up to each individual misc device driver to do it (to
be fair, that's what the C drivers do, just wanting to be sure here.)

Ah, wait, I get it, you are just storing the "raw" pointer to the rust
implementation of the structure, NOT the C "raw" pointer like it
currently is today.  You are making this all match up with the existing
code.

Sorry for the noise, this all makes sense to me now, I didn't have
enough coffee for that first code review.

True, ok, that's fine.

Care to respin this with at least the typo fixed?
