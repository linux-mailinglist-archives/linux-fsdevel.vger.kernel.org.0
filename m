Umm, it is pretty clear you overflow when you do a

#define EXT_CAP_FOO   (1U << 16)

and assign it u16.  Just about every static checker will tell you
even if you don't instantly see it.  Basic testing will also show
you it won't work..

Well, it needs to go into the code actually explaining what the flag
does.  Throwing an undocumented flag into a uapi is just asking for
trouble.

You only know they can't co-exist when you add them, and at that point
you can add a union.

I can't follow the argument.  But if you reserve space at the beginning
of the structure instead of the usual end you'd better add a comment
explaining it.
