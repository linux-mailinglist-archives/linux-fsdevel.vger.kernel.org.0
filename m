Thank you for your suggestion.

By using these methods above instead of eventfd, CPU consumption can 
indeed be reduced.

But this requires modifying some user mode programs. Some of the 
programs on the test vehicle are our own and can be modified; But there 
is still a portion from various suppliers, and some even only deliver 
binary, which is difficult to change.

And the kernel is open source, if it can be optimized, all user mode 
programs can benefit from it.

You also mentioned that "AFAICS this boils down to batching a number of 
updates and collecting them at some interval."
Yes, it's also similar to 'TCP's silly windw syndrome':

eventfd_write has two stages: adding one to the counter and waking up 
the reader process. The former has low overhead, while the latter has 
very high overhead. And the current situation is:
Every time the counter is incremented by 1, the read side process needs 
to be awakened. When such operations are frequently performed, a lot of 
time is wasted on awakening.

This patch is also inspired by algorithms such as Nagle and Cork. It 
attempts to delay wake-up, accumulate a larger counter value, and then 
wake up the reader process to consume the accumulated counter value at once.

Eventfd has already provided the NON-SEMAPHORE attribute, but it has not 
been used yet. We look forward to your collaboration in using it 
together to solve such problems.
