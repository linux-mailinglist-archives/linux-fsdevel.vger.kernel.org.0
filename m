I would expect the most common case being none of them.
So you'd have a uid/gid range carved out of your own allocation which is
used to unpack images, let's call that the image map.

Your containers would then use a uid/gid map which is distinct from that map
and distinct from each other but all using the image map as their
fsuid/fsgid map.

This will make the VFS behave in a normal way and would also allow for
shared paths between those containers by using a shared directory
through bind-mount which is also owned by a uid/gid in that image range.
