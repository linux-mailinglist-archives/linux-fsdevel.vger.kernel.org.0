Strange. Thanks for report. Looks like some issue got created / exposed
somewhere between 5.5 and 5.9 (actually probably between 5.5 and 5.7
because the Linaro report you mentioned [1] is from 5.7-rc6). There were
no changes in this area in fanotify, I think it must have been some x86
change that triggered this. Hum, looking into x86 changelog in that time
range there was a series rewriting 32-bit ABI [2] that got merged into
5.7-rc1. Can you perhaps check whether 5.6 is good and 5.7-rc1 is bad?

Brian, any idea whether your series could regress fanotify_mark(2) syscall?
Do we have somewhere documented which syscalls need compat wrappers and how
they should look like?
