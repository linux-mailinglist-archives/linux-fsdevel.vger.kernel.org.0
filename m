Do I understand correctly that all the relocks are to look up the VMA
associated with each address, one page at a time?  That's especially
wasteful as dump_user_range() is called separately for each VMA, so it's
going to find the same VMA every time anyway.

That seems like a good idea.

It seems like some of the <linux/pagewalk.h> APIs might be relevant?
Not sure which one has the right semantics.  Can we just use
folio_walk_start()?

I guess the main complexity is every time we find a page, we have to
stop the walk, unlock mmap_sem, call dump_emit_page(), and restart the
walk from the next address.  Maybe an mm expert can weigh in.
