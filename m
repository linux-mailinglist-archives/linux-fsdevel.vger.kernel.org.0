I thought it had been too.

I am in the middle of untangling the dependencies between ptrace,
coredump, signal handling and maybe a few related things.

Do folks have a reproducer I can look at?  Pavel especially if you have
something that reproduces on the current kernels.

As part of that I am in the process of guaranteeing all of the coredump
work happens in get_signal so nothing of io_uring or any cleanup
anywhere else runs until the coredump completes.

I haven't quite posted the code for review because it's the holidays.
But I am aiming at v5.17 or possibly v5.18, as the code is just about
ready.

Eric
