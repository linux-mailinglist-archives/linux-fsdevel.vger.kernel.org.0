But the reason for the put_f mess is the fact that the function accepts either a
string (which it resolves to a struct filename that it then owns) or a struct
filename (that it does not own), not the meddling with the refcount. I'm not
trying to argue that we should do the meddling though, I'm fine with the other
approach.

OK, that makes things much simpler.

OK.

Yeah, I just was not sure about naming or whether you'd prefer for other
functions to be changed too. You've answered pretty much all my questions and
even more :)

Thanks a lot Al! I'll post v2 soon (since the audit thing you've discovered does
not affect this patch directly).
