No problem, I forgot about this as well :)

Fair enough.

We have virtual filesystems with all sorts of missing or weird notification
functionality and we don't flag that in any way. So making a special flag
for network filesystems seems a bit arbitrary. I'd just make them provide
fsid and be done with it.

Yeah, right, forgot about this one. Thanks for reminding me. But this is
mostly a kernel internal implementation issue and doesn't seem to be a
principial problem so I'd prefer not to complicate the uAPI for this. We
could for example mandate a special super_operation for fetching fsid for a
dentry for filesystems which don't have uniform fsids over the whole
filesystem (i.e., btrfs) and call this when generating event for such
filesystems. Or am I missing some other complication?

Ack.

I'm not sold on the special flag yet (see above) ;).
