Took a quick look, and it's not that trivial. The problem is you have
to wake the task to reap events anyway, this cannot be checked at
wakeup time. And now you lose the nice benefit of reducing the
context switch rate, which was a good chunk of the win here...

This can obviously very easily be done with io_uring, since that's
how it already works in terms of waiting. The min-wait part was done
separately there, though hasn't been posted or included upstream yet.

So now we're a bit stuck...
