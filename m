I'm happy to help.

Indeed and also on irc.oftc.net on #kdevops too if you prefer IRC.
But discord seems to be more happening for kdevops these days.

Indeed so our latest baseline is in

workflows/fstests/expunges/6.1.39/xfs/unassigned/

You want to first run at least one loop to confirm your setup is fine
and that you don't find any other failures other than the ones above.

Please read:

https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops
https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/blob/master/docs/requirements.md
https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/blob/master/docs/kdevops-first-run.md
https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/blob/master/docs/kdevops-mirror.md

And the video demonstrations. Then I'm happy to schedule some time to
cover anything the docs didn't cover, in particular to help you test new
patches you wish to backport for a stable kernel and the testing
criteria for that.

  Luis
