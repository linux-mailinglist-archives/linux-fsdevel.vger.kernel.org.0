I actually ran some numbers this morning. The test base is 5.13+, and
CONFIG_AUDIT=y and CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL=y is set for both the baseline
test and the test with this series applied. I used your git branch as of
this morning.

The test case is my usual peak perf test, which is random reads at
QD=128 and using polled IO. It's a single core test, not threaded. I ran
two different tests - one was having a thread just do the IO, the other
is using SQPOLL to do the IO for us. The device is capable than more
IOPS than a single core can deliver, so we're CPU limited in this test.
Hence it's a good test case as it does actual work, and shows software
overhead quite nicely. Runs are very stable (less than 0.5% difference
between runs on the same base), yet I did average 4 runs.

Kernel		SQPOLL		IOPS		Perf diff
---------------------------------------------------------
5.13		0		3029872		0.0%
5.13		1		3031056		0.0%
5.13 + audit	0		2894160		-4.5%
5.13 + audit	1		2886168		-4.8%

That's an immediate drop in perf of almost 5%. Looking at a quick
profile of it (nothing fancy, just checking for 'audit' in the profile)
shows this:

+    2.17%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_uring_entry
+    0.71%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_uring_exit
     0.07%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_syscall_entry
     0.02%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_syscall_exit

Note that this is with _no_ rules!

We don't audit read/write from aio, as mentioned. In the past two
decades, I take it that hasn't been a concern? I agree that some opcodes
should _definitely_ be audited. Things like opening a file, closing a
file, removing/creating a file, mount, etc. But normal read/write, I
think that's just utter noise and not useful at all. Auditing on a
per-opcode basis is trivial, io_uring already has provisions for
flagging opcode requirements and this would just be another one.
