What's the results when you enable the lazytime mount option to
elide almost all the timestamp updates from buffered writes?

As it is, on my test setup:

# fio --readwrite=write --filesize=5g --filename=/mnt/scratch/foo --runtime=30s --time_based --ioengine=libaio --direct=0 --bs=4k --iodepth=1 --numjobs=1 -name=/mnt/scratch/foobar --group_reporting --fallocate=none
.....
write: IOPS=296k, BW=1157MiB/s (1213MB/s)(33.9GiB/30001msec); 0 zone resets

So buffered IO is getting ~295k IOPS on a default kernel config.
Using --ioengine=psync gets ~325k IOPS. However, using
--ioengine=io_uring I only get:

.....
write: IOPS=58.5k, BW=229MiB/s (240MB/s)(6861MiB/30001msec); 0 zone resets

~60k IOPS. IOWs, normal buffered IO is 5x faster than the io_uring
slow path.

To summarise:

		seq IOPS	rand IOPS
libaio		~295k		~220k
psync		~325k		~255k
io_uring	 ~60k		 ~45k

IOWs, there's nothing wrong with the normal blocking IO path and it
easily reaches full single CPU performance on this machine. However,
there is a massive increase in overhead in using the io_uring slow
path.

Oh, wow, an average of 5 context switches per buffered write IO with
io_uring? There's zero context switches with psync or libaio. That
blocking path overhead seems like a general candidate for io_uring
optimisation, especially as most buffered writes are going to
require blocking for one reason or another regardless of whether we
add a NOWAIT fast path or not...

Improving the slow path so it's only half as slow as the existing
psync/libaio IO paths would also be a major improvement for mixed
workloads...

I haven't even looked at the patches yet, but this gets a hard NACK.
Unbound GFP_ATOMIC allocations in a user controlled context is a
total non-starter.

I don't like the sound of that. Separating the stripping of
SUID/SGID bits and other important things from the check opens a
potential window between the check and action where state changes
can be made that the check/action haven't taken into account...

This seems like a dangerous architectural direction to be headed as
it introduces an uncloseable race window where things can change
between checks and actions. Especially as it's likely easily
controllable from userspace because of the locking involved in
filesystem modification operations....

Isn't this exactly what the lazytime mount option already gives us?

How have you tested this? How does it interact with non io-uring
writers to files on the same fs/backing device? How does it interact
with other devices when they are at full writeback speed and
throttling writes on the dirty limits, too?

Cheers,

Dave.
