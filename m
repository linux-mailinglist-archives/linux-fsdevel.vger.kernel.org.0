No.  I was just asking to make certain I understood what you said.

I thought you said you were getting a consistent 0 byte coredump,
and that implied that TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL was coming in before
the coredump even started.

If you are getting partial coredumps that completely makes sense.



I was hoping that by this time Jens or Oleg would have been able to
chime in and at least confirm I am not missing something subtle.

I was afraid for a little bit that the file system code in called in
dump_emit would be checking signal_pending.  After looking into that I
see that the filesystem code very reasonably limits itself to testing
fatal_signal_pending (because by definition disk I/O on unix is not
interruptible).

So I will spin up a good version of my patch (based on your patch)
so we can unbreak coredumps.

Eric
