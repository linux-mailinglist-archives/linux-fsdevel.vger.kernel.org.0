Thanks for the pointers. They all seem plausible symptoms of work items
getting bounced across slow cache boundaries. I'm off for a few weeks so
can't really dig in right now but will get to it afterwards.

Oh yeah, pwq management side is pretty involved, being dynamic and all. I
just couldn't think of anything in the issue & execution path which would
explain the reported significant performance penalty. The issue path
differences come down to node selection and dynamic pwq release handling,
neither of which should be in play in this case.

Hmm... on recent x86 cpus, that'd just end up paring up the hyperthreads,
which would likely be too narrow especially given that l3's on recent cpus
seem pretty fast. I think what I need to do is generalizing the numa logic
so that it can sit on any of these topological boundaries and let arch
define the default boundary and let each wq to override the selection.

Another related shortcoming is that while the unbound wq's say "let the
scheduler figure out the best solution within the boundary", they don't
communicate the locality of work item to the scheduler at all, so within
each boundary, from scheduler pov, the assignment is completely random. Down
the line, it'd probably help if wq can provide some hints re. the expected
locality.

Thanks.
