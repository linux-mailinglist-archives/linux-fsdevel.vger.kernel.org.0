[I didn't find an ideal message to reply to in this thread, but this
seemed to probably be the best]

Just an update on this since I went back and looked at this thread,
GitLab about ~1yr ago turned on core.fsyncObjectFiles=true by
default.

The reason is detailed in [1], tl;dr: empty loose object file issue on
ext4 allegedly caused by a lack of core.fsyncObjectFiles=true, but I
didn't do any root cause analysis. Just noting it here for for future
reference.
