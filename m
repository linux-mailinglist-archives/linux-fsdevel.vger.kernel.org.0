I think that f_mode will be more heavily used because it's checked
everytime you call fget variants. For example, f_mode is used to check
whether the file you're about to get a reference to is an O_PATH file
and, depending on the fget variant that the caller used, denies or
allows the caller to get a reference on that file depending on whether
FMODE_PATH is or isn't set. So you have 

        if (unlikely(file->f_mode & mask))
        if (unlikely(!get_file_rcu(file))) // this is just try to bump f_count

everytime you call an fget variant which should be substantial. Other
places are fdget_pos() where f_mode is also checked right after an
fdget()...
