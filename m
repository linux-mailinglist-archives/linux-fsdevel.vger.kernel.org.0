FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT?

You're definitely right that the gup path is broken which I didn't notice
when reading...  I know I shouldn't review such a still slightly involved
patch during travel. :(

I still think maybe we have chance to generalize at least the fault path,
I'd still start with something like having just 2-3 archs having a shared
routine handle only some part of the fault path (I remember there was a
previous discussion previously, but I didn't follow up much from there..).

So even if we still need duplicates over many archs, we'll start to have
something we can use as a baseline in fault path.  Does it sound a sane
thing to consider as a start, or maybe not?

The other question - considering RETRY_NOWAIT being there - do we still
want to have something like what Johannes proposed first to fix the problem
(with all arch and gup fixed)?  I'd think yes, but I could missed something.

Thanks,
