Nevermind. I think your patch is correct now that I've looked again. 

Thread2 is still holding the blocked_lock_lock, and that should be
enough to prevent the block from being freed out from under it. Since we
have to take the blocked_lock_lock in this codepath, that ensures that
Thread2 is either able to safely issue the wake_up, of that it won't
find the block on the list.

I'll go ahead and put this in linux-next for now, and will plan to get
this to Linus before v5.6 ships.

Thanks!
