I think it makes sense. As Linus has referenced, the sex appeal of
splice is the fact that it is dealing with pipes, and you can access
these internal buffers through other means. But that is probably largely
just something that is sexy design wise, nothing that _really_ matters
in practice. And the pipes do get in the way, for example I had to add
pipe resizing fcntl helpers to bump the size. If you're doing a plain
sendfile, the pipes just kind of get in the way too imho.

Another upside (from the io_uring) perspective is that splice isn't very
efficient through io_uring, as it requires offload to io-wq. This could
obviously be solved by some refactoring in terms of non-blocking, but it
hasn't really been that relevant (and nobody has complained about it). A
new sendfile op would nicely get around that too as it could be designed
with async in nature, rather than the classic sync syscall model that
splice follows.
