	The situation with #work.fs_parse is simple: I'm waiting for NFS series
to get in (git://git.linux-nfs.org/projects/anna/linux-nfs.git, that is).
 As soon as it happens, I'm sending #work.fs_parse + merge with nfs stuff +
fixups for said nfs stuff (as in
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs.git/commit/?id=c354ed1)
to Linus.  In case Anna decides to skip this cycle (and I've seen nothing that
might indicates that), I will just send #work.fs_parse as-is.

	I *can* rebase #work.fs_parse on top of NFS series (and vboxsf, and
exfat, etc.) and send it to Linus right before -rc1, with obviously identical
final state.  That would avoid all issues with bisect hazards, but Linus is
usually unhappy about rebases.  And bisect hazard window is narrow...

	Again, I've no problem with such rebase (hell, with additional
branch ending in the same tree as #merge.nfs-fs_parse, verifiable by
simple git diff - compare vfs.git merge.nfs-fs_parse.0 and
merge.nfs-fs_parse.1, the latter being a rebase on top of #nfs-next).
Linus, up to you...
