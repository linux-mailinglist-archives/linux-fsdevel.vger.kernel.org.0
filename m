Want to try out my new ringbuffer syscall?

I haven't yet dug far into the fuse protocol or /dev/fuse code yet, only
skimmed. But using it to replace the read/write syscall overhead should
be straightforward; you'll want to spin up a kthread for responding to
requests.

The next thing I was going to look at is how you guys are using splice,
we want to get away from that too.

Brian was also saying the fuse virtio_fs code may be worth
investigating, maybe that could be adapted?
