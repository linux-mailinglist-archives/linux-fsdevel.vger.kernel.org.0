This would be why audit needs to monitor a thread until it wraps up, to
wait for the result code.  My understanding is that both sync and async
parts of an op would be monitored.

Some parts do, some parts don't depending on what they are interacting
with in the kernel.  It can be made to not sleep if needed.
