True.  But block/fops.c should simply not the write hint in that
case (or even do a bit of folding if we care enough).

Your series simply mixes up the existing write (temperature) hint and
the write stream, including for file system use.  This version does
something very similar, but only for block devices.

True.  Did I managed this was a quick hack job?

Those are just hints as well, but I agree you probably get much
better results if they do.

I could move it forward, but right now I'm more than over subsribed.
If someone actually pushing for this work could put more effort into it
it will surely be faster.
