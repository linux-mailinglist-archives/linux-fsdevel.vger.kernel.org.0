Fwiw, putting down my kernel hat and speaking as someone who maintains
two container runtimes and various other low-level bits and pieces in
userspace who'd make heavy use of this stuff I would prefer the fd-based
fsinfo() approach especially in the light of across namespace
operations, querying all properties of a mount atomically all-at-once,
and safe delegation through fds. Another heavy user of this would be
systemd (Cced Lennart who I've discussed this with) which would prefer
the fd-based approach as well. I think pulling this into a filesystem
and making userspace parse around in a filesystem tree to query mount
information is the wrong approach and will get messy pretty quickly
especially in the face of mount and user namespace interactions and
various other pitfalls. fsinfo() fits quite nicely with the all-fd-based
approach of the whole mount api. So yes, definitely preferred from my
end.
