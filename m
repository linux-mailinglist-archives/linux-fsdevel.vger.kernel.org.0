Hi Ritesh and Benjamin,

I have read the context in [1]. It seems your tool has already used new 
mount api to mount the hostfs. It now rejects unknown mount options as 
many other filesystems do regardless of its earlier behavior (which 
treats any option as the root directory in hostfs).

This should be clarified for unknown option. For older hostfs (before 
new mount api), it treats the whole string behind -o as the root 
directory. This will allow any mount options, but also limit its 
extension. It is not the same as other mainline filesystems which will 
split the option string with ','. So for these filesystems, they can 
consider whether reject unknown mount options or not.

I'm not sure it is reasonable in this way. If we accept unknown option 
in the hostfs, it will be treated as root directory. But which one 
should be used (like mount -t hostfs -o unknown,/root/directory none 
/mnt). So in the conversion, we introduce the `hostfs` key to mark the 
root directory. May be we need more discussion about use case.

Thanks,
Hongbo
