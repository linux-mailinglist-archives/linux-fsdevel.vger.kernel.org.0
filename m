But that assumes the file system could actually support it.  Which
is hard when you don't assume the file system isn't simply a passthrough
entity, which will not give you great results.

If you want to do useful stream separation you need to write data
sequentially into the stream.  Now with streams or FDP that does not
actually imply sequentially in LBA space, but if you want the file
system to not actually deal with fragmentation from hell, and be
easily track what is grouped together you really want it sequentially
in the LBA space as well.  In other words, any kind of write placement
needs to be intimately tied to the file system block allocator.

As mentioned above just passing it down is not actually very useful.
It might give you nice benchmark numbers when you basically reimplement
space management in userspace on a fully preallocated file, but for that
you're better of just using the block device.  If you actually want
to treat the files as files you need full file system involvement.

Yes, and now you'll get complaints that the file system ignores it
when it can't properly support it.  This is why we need a per-fop
opt in.

Yes, and that is a problem.  We stopped doing that, but Samsung sneaked
some of this back in recently as I noticed.

I have the gut feeling that you've just run benchmarks on image files
emulating block devices and not actually tried real file system workloads
based on this unfortunately.
