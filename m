There is a time and a place for rules, and there is a time and a place
for using your head and exercising some common sense and judgement.

I'm the one who's responsible for making sure that bcachefs users have a
working filesystem. That means reading and responding to every bug
report and keeping track of what's working and what's not in
fs/bcachefs/. Not you, and not Linus.

There's no need for any of this micromanaging, which is what this has
turned into. All it's been doing is generating conflict and drama.

I've often told people that they should probably wait before switching,
particularly when they need features that aren't ready yet (erasure
coding), and things are not yet so trouble free that I would recommend
normal users switch.

Besides the most basic "will it eat your data", there's a lot of other
things to consider, like "is it providing stable backports yet" (I'm
explicitly not) or "is there wonky behaviour or missing APIs still to be
worked out" (yes, there definitely is, and I'm still triaging so there
will be awhile).

None of that changes my most basic responsibility.

No, I'm not saying that they don't care about user data.

I know most of the other filesystem developers, particularly the XFS
ones; I'm not trying to disparage their work.

But track records do matter, and bcachefs has a good one, and I intend
to keep it that way.
