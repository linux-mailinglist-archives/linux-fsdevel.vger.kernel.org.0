Well that is how I had started, but it was getting ugly. Besides, I was
moving everything to a new iomap.c file. So, I think I will change the
relevant code in place and then try to move it to iomap.c, depending
on how big the file is..

No wonder I was not getting any reviews from the btrfs developers!

It was a part btrfs code which is carried forward. Yes, we don't need
the page dirtying and uptodate since iomap does it for us.

Yes, I should focus on what it should be called eventually as opposed to
the transition.
