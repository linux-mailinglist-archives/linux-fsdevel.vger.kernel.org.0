Could you turn that WARN_ON(count < 0) into
	if (WARN_ON(count < 0))
		printk(KERN_ERR "id = %d, dev = %s, count = %d\n",
				mnt->mnt_id,
				mnt->mnt_sb->s_id,
				count);
add system("cat /proc/self/mountinfo"); right after sandbox_common()
call and try to reproduce that?

I really wonder what mount is it happening to.  BTW, how painful would
it be to teach syzcaller to turn those cascades of
	NONFAILING(*(uint8_t*)0x20000080 = 0x12);
	NONFAILING(*(uint8_t*)0x20000081 = 0);
	NONFAILING(*(uint16_t*)0x20000082 = 0);
	NONFAILING(*(uint32_t*)0x20000084 = 0xffffff9c);
	NONFAILING(*(uint64_t*)0x20000088 = 0);
	NONFAILING(*(uint64_t*)0x20000090 = 0x20000180);
	NONFAILING(memcpy((void*)0x20000180, "./file0\000", 8));
	NONFAILING(*(uint32_t*)0x20000098 = 0);
	NONFAILING(*(uint32_t*)0x2000009c = 0x80);
	NONFAILING(*(uint64_t*)0x200000a0 = 0x23456);
	....
	NONFAILING(syz_io_uring_submit(r[1], r[2], 0x20000080, 0));
into something more readable?  Bloody annoyance every time...  Sure, I can
manually translate it into
	struct io_uring_sqe *sqe = (void *)0x20000080;
	char *s = (void *)0x20000180;
	memset(sqe, '\0', sizeof(*sqe));
	sqe->opcode = 0x12; // IORING_OP_OPENAT?
	sqe->fd = -100;	// AT_FDCWD?
	sqe->addr = s;
	strcpy(s, "./file0");
	sqe->open_flags = 0x80;	// O_EXCL???
	sqe->user_data = 0x23456;	// random tag?
	syz_io_uring_submit(r[1], r[2], (unsigned long)p, 0);
but it's really annoying as hell, especially since syz_io_uring_submit()
comes from syzcaller and the damn thing _knows_ that the third argument
is sodding io_uring_sqe, and never passed to anything other than
memcpy() in there, at that, so the exact address can't matter.

Incidentally, solitary O_EXCL (without O_CREAT) is... curious.  Does that
sucker still trigger without it?  I.e. with store to 0x2000009c replaced
with storing 0?
