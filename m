This is the wrong way to go.  Really.  Look at it that way - LOOKUP_REVAL
is the final stage of escalation; if we had to go there, there's no
point being optimistic about the last dcache lookup, nevermind trying
to retry the parent pathwalk if we fail with -ESTALE doing it.

I'm not saying that it's something worth optimizing for; the problem
is different - the logics makes no sense whatsoever that way.  It's
a matter of reader's cycles wasted on "what the fuck are we trying
to do here?", not the CPU cycles wasted on execution.

While we are at it, it makes no sense for filename_parentat() and its
ilk to go for RCU and normal if it's been given LOOKUP_REVAL - I mean,
look at the sequence of calls in there.  And try to make sense of
it.  Especially of the "OK, RCU attempt told us to sod off and try normal;
here, let's call path_parentat() with LOOKUP_REVAL for flags and if it
says -ESTALE, call it again with exact same arguments" part.

Seriously, look at that from the point of view of somebody who tries
to make sense of the entire thing.
