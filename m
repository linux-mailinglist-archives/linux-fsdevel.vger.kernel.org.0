Thanks for this RFC, this is interesting!

I previously thought a lot about IOCTLs restrictions and here are some 
notes:

IOCTLs are everywhere, from devices to filesystems (see fscrypt). Each 
different file type may behave differently for the same IOCTL 
command/ID. It is also worth noting that there are a lot of different 
IOCTLs, they are growing over time, some might be dedicated to get some 
data (i.e. read) and others to change the state of a device (i.e. 
write), some might be innocuous (e.g. FIOCLEX, FIONCLEX) and others 
potentially harmful. _IOC_READ and _IOC_WRITE can be useful but they are 
not mandatory, there are exceptions, and it may be difficult to identify 
if a command pertains to one, the other, or both kind of actions.

I then think it would be very useful to be able to tie file/device types 
to a set of IOCTLs, letting user space libraries define and classify the 
IOCTL semantic.

Instead of relying on a LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL which would allow or 
deny all IOCTLs, we can extend the path_beneath struct to manage IOCTLs 
in addition to regular file accesses. Because dealing with a set of 
IOCTLs would imply to deal with a lot of data and combinations, I 
thought about creating groups of IOCTLs (defining access semantic) that 
could be matched against file hierarchies. The composability nature of 
Landlock domains is also another constraint to keep in mind.

// New rule type dedicated to define groups of IOCTLs.
struct landlock_ioctl_attr {
   __u32 command; // IOCTL number/ID
   dev_t device; // must be 0 for regular file and directory
   __u8 file_type;
   __u8 id_mask; // if 0, then applied globally
};

We could use landlock_add_rule(2) to fill a set of landlock_ioctl_attr 
into a ruleset and use them with landlock_path_beneath_attr entries:

// LANDLOCK_RULE_PATH_BENEATH, leveraging the extensible design of
// landlock_path_beneath_attr, hence the same first fields.
struct landlock_path_beneath_attr {
   __u64 allowed_access;
   __s32 parent_fd;
   __u16 allowed_ioctl_id_mask;
};

landlock_ioctl_attr includes a 8-bit mask for which each bit identifies 
a set of allowed IOCTLs per device/file type. This mask is then tied to 
a path_beneath_attr. We cannot use number IDs because of dev_t+IOCTL->ID 
intersection conflicts. Using an id_mask enables to group (specific) 
IOCTLs together, then creating synthetic access rights.

When merging a ruleset with a domain, each IOCTL ID mask is shifted and 
ORed with the other layer ones to get a (8*16) 128-bit mask, stored in 
an IOCTL/dev_t table and in the related landlock_object. When looking 
for an IOCTL request, Landlock first looks into the IOCTL set ID table 
and get the global set ID mask, which kind of translates to a 
composition of synthetic access rights (stored with the 
landlock_layer.ioctl_access bitmask). We then walk through all the 
inodes to match the whole mask.

I realize that this is complex and this explanation might be confusing 
though. What do you think?

I value this simplicity, but I'm also wondering about how much this 
allow/deny all IOCTLs approach would be useful in real case scenarios. ;)

In the long term, I'd like Landlock to be able to restrict a set of 
IOCTLs, taking into account the type of file/device. Being able to deny 
all IOCTLs might be useful and is much easier to implement though.

This is indeed interesting, and that should be useful for the cases you 
explained. I think supporting IOCTLs is more important for now, but a 
new syscall to restrict FDs could be useful in the future. We should 
also think about batch operations on FD (see the close_range syscall), 
for instance to deny all IOCTLs on inherited or received FDs.
