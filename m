The setsock issue is a little more complicated.  Let me try to summarize
it:

 - setsock takes a (user) pointer and len
 - unfortunately while the designed of the BSD socket API designed the
   len to be correct some protocol implementations have been sloppy
   and just use a hardcoded len for the value plus some other funnies
 - unfortunately there is some BPF magic that can attach to a socket
   and be run, and that (and only that in the latest kernel) can cause
   a setsockopt to take a kernel buffer.  One that was copied from
   userspace earlier and had the BPF program run on it.
 - unfortunately we have about 90 ->setsockopt instances, and the BPF
   hook is not specific to one particular of them.  In fact the
   BPF program can run for options that don't even exist, and based on
   my previous dicussion Facebook has setups that rely on that.

But except for setsockopt we don't really have anything like that left.
There is some alpha arch code that would need to be duplicated for
user vs kernel pointers, but I suspect it will get cleaner by that,
and the messy s390 crypto driver wh—ñch will be a bit of work, but all
internal to that driver.

So based on that I'd rather get away without our flag and tag the
kernel pointer case in setsockopt explicitly.
