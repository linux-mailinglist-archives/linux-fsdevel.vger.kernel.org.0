Actually this is a typo and I originally meant that waiting for
writeback in fuse_send_readpages() is unneeded as page cache won't be
freed until the writeback IO completes.

In fact the above waiting for writeback in fuse_send_write_pages() is
needed.  The reason is as follows:

I think mmap write could make the page dirty and the writeback could be
triggered then.

I mean there won't be duplicate *writeback* rather than *write* for the
same page.  You could write the page cache and make it dirty at the time
when the writeback for the same page is still on going, as long as we
can ensure that even when the page is dirtied again, there won't be a
duplicate writeback IO for the same page when the previous writeback IO
has not completed yet.
