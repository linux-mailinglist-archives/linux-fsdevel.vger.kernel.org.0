Hi Bernd,

Those are impressive results!

When approaching the FUSE uring feature from marketing POV,
I think that putting the emphasis on metadata operations is the
best approach.

Not the dio reads are not important (I know that is part of your use case),
but I imagine there are a lot more people out there waiting for
improvement in metadata operations overhead.

To me it helps to know what the current main pain points are
for people using FUSE filesystems wrt performance.

Although it may not be uptodate, the most comprehensive
study about FUSE performance overhead is this FAST17 paper:

https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast17/fast17-vangoor.pdf

In this paper, table 3 summarizes the different overheads observed
per workload. According to this table, the workloads that degrade
performance worse on an optimized passthrough fs over SSD are:
- many file creates
- many file deletes
- many small file reads
In all these workloads, it was millions of files over many directories.
The highest performance regression reported was -83% on many
small file creations.

The moral of this long story is that it would be nice to know
what performance improvement FUSE uring can aspire to.
This is especially relevant for people that would be interested
in combining the benefits of FUSE passthrough (for data) and
FUSE uring (for metadata).

What did passthrough_hp do in your patched version with creates?
Did it actually create the files?
In how many directories?
Maybe the directory inode lock impeded performance improvement
with >=3D8 threads?

Is that going to improve performance in any real life workload?
