Thanks. I didn't respond last night when I read Amir's decription
because I wanted to think it over. Knowing where the unmount event
requirement certainly helps.

I am probably missing something important, but it really seems to me
that the object reference counting model is the back to
front.  Currently the mark is being attached to the inode and then
the inode pinned by a reference count to make the mark attached
to the inode persistent until unmount. This then requires the inodes
to be swept by unmount because fsnotify has effectively leaked them
as it isn't tracking such inodes itself.

[ Keep in mind that I'm not saying this was a bad or wrong thing to
do because the s_inodes list was there to be able to do this sort of
lazy cleanup. But now that we want to remove the s_inodes list if at
all possible, it is a problem we need to solve differently. ]

AFAICT, inotify does not appear to require the inode to send events
- it only requires access to the inode mark itself. Hence it does
not the inode in cache to generate IN_UNMOUNT events, it just
needs the mark itself to be findable at unmount.  Do any of the
other backends that require unmount notifications that require
special access to the inode itself?

If not, and the fsnotify sb info is tracking these persistent marks,
then we don't need to iterate inodes at unmount. This means we don't
need to pin inodes when they have marks attached, and so the
dependency on the s_inodes list goes away.

With this inverted model, we need the first fsnotify event callout
after the inode is instantiated to look for a persistent mark for
the inode. We know how to do this efficiently - it's exactly the
same caching model we use for ACLs. On the first lookup, we check
the inode for ACL data and set the ACL pointer appropriately to
indicate that a lookup has been done and there are no ACLs
associated with the inode.

At this point, the fsnotify inode marks can all be removed from the
inode when it is being evicted and there's no need for fsnotify to
pin inodes at all.

I don't think that is necessary. We need to get rid of the inode
reference, not move where we track inode references. The persistent
object is the fsnotify mark, not the cached inode. It's the mark
that needs to be persistent, and that's what the fsnotify code
should be tracking.

The fsnotify marks are much smaller than inodes, and there going to
be fewer cached marks than inodes, especially once inode pinning is
removed. Hence I think this will result in a net reduction in memory
footprint for "marked-until-unmount" configurations as we won't pin
nearly as many inodes in cache...

Yes, I am exploring what it would take to get rid of i_sb_list
altogether right now. That, I don't think this is a concern given
the difference in memory footprint of the same number of persistent
marks. i.e. "persistent mark, reclaimable inode" will always have a
significantly lower memory footprint than "persistent inode and
mark" under memory pressure....

I don't think that's quite true. Quota is not modular, so we can
lazily free quota objects even when quota is turned off. All we need
to ensure is that code checks whether quota is enabled, not for the
existence of quota objects attached to the inode.

Hence quota-off simply turns off all the quota operations in memory,
and normal inode eviction cleans up the stale quota objects
naturally.

My main question is why the quota-on add_dquot_ref() pass is
required. AFAICT all of the filesystem operations that will modify
quota call dquot_initialize() directly to attach the required dquots
to the inode before the operation is started. If that's true, then
why does quota-on need to do this for all the inodes that are
already in cache?

i.e. I'm not sure I understand why we need quota to do these
iterations at all...

Sure, this is how XFS works, too. But I think this behaviour is
largely irrelevant because there are still filesystems out there
that do stuff the old way...

I'm not sure that matters, though it adds to the reasons why we
should be removing old, unmaintained filesystems from the tree
and old, outdated formats from maintained filesystems....

AFAICT, most of the subsystems don't need to track inodes directly.

We don't need s_inodes for evict_inodes() - we have the inode LRU
tracking all unreferenced inodes on the superblock. The GFS2 use
case can probably walk the inode LRU directly, too.

It looks to me that we can avoid needing unmount iteration for
fsnotify, and I suspect landlock can likely use the same persistence
inversion as fsnotify (same persistent ruleset model).

The bdev superblock can implement it's own internal list using
inode->i_devices as this list_head is only used by chardev
inodes.

All that then remains is the page cache dropping code, and that's
not really critical to have exacting behaviour. We certainly
shouldn't be taking a runtime penalty just to optimise the rare
case of dropping caches..

IOWs, there aren't that many users, and I think there are ways to
make all these iterations go away without adding new per-inode
list heads to track inodes.

-Dave.
