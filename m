This has to be performance proven and is no means what I'm seeing. How
should io-uring improve performance if you have the same number of
system calls?

As I see it (@Jens or @Pavel or anyone else please correct me if I'm
wrong), advantage of io-uring comes when there is no syscall overhead at
all - either you have a ring with multiple entries and then one side
operates on multiple entries or you have polling and no syscall overhead
either. We cannot afford cpu intensive polling - out of question,
besides that I had even tried SQPOLL and it made things worse (that is
actually where my idea about application polling comes from).
As I see it, for sync blocking calls (like meta operations) with one
entry in the queue, you would get no advantage with
IORING_OP_READV/IORING_OP_WRITEV -  io-uring has  do two system calls -
one to submit from kernel to userspace and another from userspace to
kernel. Why should io-uring be faster there?

And from my testing this is exactly what I had seen - io-uring for meta
requests (i.e. without a large request queue and *without* core
affinity) makes meta operations even slower that /dev/fuse.

For anything that imposes a large ring queue and where either side
(kernel or userspace) needs to process multiple ring entries - system
call overhead gets reduced by the queue size. Just for DIO or meta
operations that is hard to reach.

Also, if you are using IORING_OP_READV/IORING_OP_WRITEV, nothing would
change in fuse kernel? I.e. IOs would go via fuse_dev_read()?
I.e. we would not have encoded in the request which queue it belongs to?

Did you look at patch 12/19? It just does
fuse_uring_req_end_and_get_next(). That part isn't complex, imho.

Coud you explain what you mean with "one more memory copy"? As it is
right now, 'struct fuse_req' is always allocated as it was before and
then a copy is done to the ring entry. No difference to legacy /dev/fuse
IO, which also copies to the read buffer.

If we would avoid allocating 'struct fuse_req' when there are free ring
entry requests we would reduce copies, but never increase?

Btw, advantage for the ring is on the libfuse side, where the
fuse-request buffer is assigned to the CQE and as long as the request is
not completed, the buffer is valid. (For /dev/fuse IO that could be
solved in libfuse by decoupling request memory from the thread, but with
the current ring buffer design that just happens more naturally and
memory is limited by the queue size.)

Well, that is exactly what IORING_OP_URING_CMD is for, afaik. And
ublk_drv  also works exactly that way. I had pointed it out before,
initially I had considered to write a reverse io-uring myself and then
exactly at that time ublk came up.

The interface of that 'reverse io' to io-uring is really simple.

1) Userspace sends a IORING_OP_URING_CMD SQE
2) That CMD gets handled/queued by struct file_operations::uring_cmd /
fuse_uring_cmd(). fuse_uring_cmd() returns -EIOCBQUEUED and queues the
request
3) When fuse client has data to complete the request, it calls
io_uring_cmd_done() and fuse server receives a CQE with the fuse request.

Personally I don't see anything twisted here, one just needs to
understand that IORING_OP_URING_CMD was written for that reverse order.

(There came up a light twisting when io-uring introduced issue_flags -
that is part of discussion of patch 19/19 with Jens in the series. Jens
suggested to work on io-uring improvements once the main series is
merged. I.e. patch 19/19 will be dropped in RFCv3 and I'm going to ask
Jens for help once the other parts are merged. Right now that easy to
work around by always submitting with an io-uring task).

Also, that simplicity is the reason why I'm hesitating a bit to work on
Kents new ring, as io-uring already has all what we need and with a
rather simple interface.

Well, maybe you mean patch 09/19 "Add a dev_release exception for
fuse-over-io-uring". Yep, that is the shutdown part I'm not too happy
about and which initially lead to the async release thread in RFCv1.

See above, for single entry blocking requests you get two system calls +
io-uring overhead.

Polling yes, but without shared memory the application thread does not
have the right to read from fuse userspace server request?

Yep, wait a few days I have seen your recent patch and I'm may to add
that to my series. I actually considered to point of that the bg queue
could be handled by that series as well, but then preferred to just add
patch for that in my series, which will make use of it for the ring queue.

To be honest, I wonder how you worked around scheduler issues on waking
up the application thread. Did you core bind application threads as well
(I mean besides fuse server threads)? We now have this (unexported)
wake_on_current_cpu. Last year that still wasn't working perfectly well
and  Hillf Danton has suggested the 'seesaw' approach. And with that the
scheduler was working very well. You could get the same with application
core binding, but with 512 CPUs that is certainly not done manually
anymore. Did you use a script to bind application threads or did you
core bind from within the application?

Ok, I'm testing only with 32 cores and two numa nodes. For final
benchmarking I could try to get a more recent AMD based system with 96
cores. I don't think we have anything near 512 CPUs in the lab. I'm not
aware of such customer systems either.

This is just another optimization. What you write is true and I was
aware of that. It was just a rather simple optimization that improved
results - enough to demo it. We can work with scheduler people in the
future on that or we add a bit of our own logic and create mapping of
cpu -> next-cpu-on-same-numa-node. Certainly an API and help from the
scheduler would be preferred.
