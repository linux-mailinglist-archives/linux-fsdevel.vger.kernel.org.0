So he has; my apologies - the obvious false duplicate in there would be
O_NDELAY vs. O_NONBLOCK and I'd misread the patch.

Commit message should've been along the lines of "O_NDELAY occurs twice
in definition of VALID_OPEN_FLAGS; get rid of the duplicate", possibly
along with "Note: O_NONBLOCK in the same expression is *not* another
duplicate - on sparc O_NONBLOCK != O_NDELAY (done that way for ABI
compatibility with Solaris back when sparc port began)".
