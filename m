Yes, I typed the wrong name, should be fget() not fdget().

Thanks for explanation, I now realize it's an issue, even for non-fixed 
files when io_uring takes full ownership. for example:

io_uring submit a getdents          --> f_count == 2, get the lock
nowait submission fails             --> f_count == 2, release the lock
punt it to io-wq thread and return to userspace
close(fd)                           --> f_count == 1
call sync getdents64                --> doing getdents without lock
the io-wq thread begins to run      --> f_count == 1, doing getdents
                                         without lock.

Though this looks like a silly use case but users can do that anyway.

How about remove this f_count > 1 small optimization in io_uring and 
always get the lock, looks like it makes big trouble for async
situation. and there may often be parallel io_uring getdents in the
same time for a file [1], it may be not very meaningful to do this
file count optimization.

[1] I believe users will issue multiple async getdents at same time 
rather than issue them one by one to get better performance.

Thanks,
Hao
