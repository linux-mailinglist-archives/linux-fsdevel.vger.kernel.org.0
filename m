Yeah, we should try that.

I really really hope that isn't the case because (4) is pretty nasty.
Having to put this on a manpage seems nightmarish.

I've detailed the semantics for that in the commit message below...

Yeah, I think that would do it and I think that's what we should try to
get away with. I just spent time and took a look who passes O_DIRECTORY
and O_CREAT and interestingly there are a number of comments roughly
along the lines of the following example:

/* Ideally we could use openat(O_DIRECTORY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL) here
 * to create and open the directory atomically

suggests that people who specify O_DIRECTORY | O_CREAT are interested in
creating a directory. But since this never did work they don't tend to
use that flag combination (I've collected a few samples in [1] to [4].).

(As a sidenote, posix made an interpretation change a long time ago to
at least allow for O_DIRECTORY | O_CREAT to create a directory (see [3]).

But that's a whole different can of worms and I haven't spent any
thoughts even on feasibility. And even if we should probably get through
a couple of kernels with O_DIRECTORY | O_CREAT failing with EINVAL first.)

This will be problematic because for weird historical reasons O_TMPFILE
includes O_DIRECTORY so this would unfortunately break O_TMPFILE. :/
I'll try to have a patch ready in a bit.

I spent a long time digging through potential users of this nonsense.
