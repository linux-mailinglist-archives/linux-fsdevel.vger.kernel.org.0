Thank you very much for applying this patch!

Adding barriers where none existed does introduce some performance
degradation. But the multi-threaded test results here look pretty
good, it's just that the single-threaded test results have a bit too
much degradation for Shell Scripts (8 concurrent).Â  I've tracked
down this test item, which calls clone() and wait4() and then triggers
isize reads and writes frequently, so the degradation here is as
expected, just not sure if anyone cares about this scenario.
