Not a bad idea - but do we have a concrete reason we want this? Our goal
has been low enough overhead to be enabled in production, and I think
we're delivering on that; perhaps we could wait and see if anyone
complains.

We've already got the runtime switch (via a static branch), so if
overhead is the concern that should cover that.

Just a single tag index directly maps to the pointer it replaces, we
should be able to do this.

Already are :)

See above - I'd prefer to be restrained with the knobs we add.
