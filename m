Sorry for the slow reply, I have to balance this with my actual job that
is not directly related to the kernel development :)

I'm no kernel concurrency expert (actually I'm not any kind of kernel
expert), but my understanding is READ_ONCE does not just mean "do not
read more than once", but rather "read exactly once" (and more than
that), and if it's not applied then the compiler is within its rights to
optimize the read out, so the compatibility check can effectively be
disabled.

I don't think it's likely to happen, but "bad things do not happen in
practice" and "it is technically correct" are two different things :)

FWIW I'm not arguing it has to be changed, I just want to understand
things better (and if it helps to spot a bug at some point then great).
So if my reasoning is wrong then please point out where. And if it's
just the simplicity / clarity of the code that is the goal here and any
negative effects are considered to be unlikely then it's OK, I can
understand that.
