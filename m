This patch series is currently in RFC form, as stated in cover letter
mostly untested. So they are not in form for merging or detailed
reviewing. I just would like to know if this is the right direction with
filesystems and if I should continue with this my effort or not.
And I thought that sending RFC "incomplete" patches is better way than
just describing what to do and how...
