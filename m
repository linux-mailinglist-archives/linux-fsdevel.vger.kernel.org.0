Hi Richard!

There is vfat+msdos driver for FAT12/16/32 in fs/fat/. Then there is
modified Samsung exfat driver which was recently merged into staging
area and supports FAT12/16/32 and exFAT. Plus there is new version of
this out-of-tree Samsung's exfat driver called sdfat which can be found
in some Android phones. Based on sdfat sources there is out-of-tree
exfat-linux [1] driver which seems to have better performance as
currently merged old modified Samsung's exfat driver into staging. This
list of available exfat drivers is not complete. There is also fuse
implementation widely used [2] and some commercial implementations from
Tuxera [3], Paragon [4], Embedded Access [5] or HCC [6]. As Konstantin
in his email wrote, implementation which he sent should be one used in
their commercial Paragon product.

So we have not 3, but at least 6 open source implementations. Plus more
closed source, commercial.

About that one implementation from Samsung, which was recently merged
into staging tree, more people wrote that code is in horrible state and
probably it should not have been merged. That implementation has
all-one-one driver FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT which basically
duplicate current kernel fs/fat code.

Quick look at this Konstantin's patch, it looks like that code is not in
such bad state as staging one. It has only exFAT support (no FAT32) but
there is no write support (yet). For me it looks like that this
Konstantin's implementation is more closer then one in staging to be
"primary" exfat implementation for kernel (if write support would be
provided).
