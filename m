You cut of a word above. I can't follow your argument.
File descriptor numbers are free to refer to whatever we want.
They don't care about what type of object they refer to and they

That's just completely weird. We can see what Linus thinks but I think
that's a somewhat outlandish proposal that I wouldn't support.
