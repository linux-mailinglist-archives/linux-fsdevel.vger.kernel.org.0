The actual call chain leading to filename_lookup() is, AFAICS, this:
	io_statx()
		do_statx()
			vfs_statx()
				user_path_at()
					user_path_at_empty()
						filename_lookup()

If you are providing such warranties for the contents of pathname
arguments, you have a bug in statx in the mainline.  If you are not,
there's no point in doing getname() in getxattr prep.

Which one it is?
