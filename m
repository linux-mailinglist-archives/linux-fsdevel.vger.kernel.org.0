Just purely for backward compatibility, I don't think you can have the
nvme driver error out if a stream is too large. The fcntl lifetime hint
never errored out before, which gets set unconditionally from the
file_inode without considering the block device's max write stream.

As far as I know, 255 possible streams exceeds any use case I know
about.

I might be something here, but that part sure looks the same as what's
in this series.

Just regarding the documentation on the write_stream_granularity, you
don't need to discard the entire RU in a single command. You can
invalidate the RU simply by overwriting the LBAs without ever issuing
any discard commands.

If you really want to treat it this way, you need to ensure the first
LBA written to an RU is always aligned to NPDA/NPDAL.

If this is really what you require to move this forward, though, that's
fine with me.
