The uffdio_api.features passed into the ioctl(UFFDIO_API) should be such
request to enable features specified in the kernel.  If the kernel doesn't
support any of the features in the list, IMHO it's very natural to fail it
as described in the man page.  That's also most of the kernel apis do
afaik, by failing any enablement of features if not supported.

Do you plan to just revert the patch?  If so, please go ahead.  IMHO we
should just follow the man page.

What I agree here is the api isn't that perfect, in that we need to create
a separate userfault file descriptor just to probe.  Currently the features
will be returned in the initial test with features=0 passed in, but it also
initializes the uffd handle even if it'll never be used but for probe only.

However since that existed in the 1st day I guess we'd better keep it
as-is.  And it's not so bad either: user app does open/close one more time,
but only once for each app's lifecycle.

Thanks,
