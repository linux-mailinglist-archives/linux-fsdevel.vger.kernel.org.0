Yes, it doesn't. Will clarify this in the commit log.

If I don't drop the pins the THP can't be split. And, there might be 
more than one pins from find_get_entries() if I read the code correctly. 
For example, truncate 8K length in the middle of THP, the THP's refcount 
would get bumpped twice sinceÂ  two sub pages would be returned.
