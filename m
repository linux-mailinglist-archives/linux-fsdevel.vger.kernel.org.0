It does indeed sound like it's TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL that will trigger some
signal_pending() and cause an interruption of the core dump. Just out of
curiosity, what is your /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern set to? If it's
set to some piped process, can you try and set it to 'core' and see if
that eliminates the truncation of the core dumps for your case?
