No worries and thanks for the quick reply :)

The way I see it, this tracking is really a best-effort, pragmatic
solution, and in the presence of server-side changes, it's not going to
always be correct (but then, because of the possibility of qid collisions,
there is not really a fully fool-proof way in any case).  In some sense
currently hard links doesn't "work" anyway in uncached mode since each
inode is separate - this doesn't change that.  Files being removed is not
a problem, and if another file with the same name is recreated, if it has
a different qid we will create a new inode anyway (since this patch really
matches against path _and_ qid).  I've not measured the slowdown, but I
think in uncached mode the time is mostly domainated communication
overhead in any case... I think.

However, alternatives do exist (as discussed above and below)

If you / anyone else would be interested in that I can implement it, but
that would probably be best done by landing the ino_path struct in this
patchset first.

Yes, that is correct (but it uses rbtree, not hash table, currently).

Landlock holds a reference to the inode in the ruleset, so they shouldn't
be dropped.  On security_sb_delete Landlock will iput those inodes so they
won't cause issue with unmounting.  There is some special mechanism
("landlock objects") to decouple the ruleset themselves from the actual
inodes, so that previously Landlocked things can keep running even after
the inode has disappeared as a result of unmounting.

Hmm, I think this would be a good way for 9pfs to expose the qid to
Landlock, by exposing it as a handle, since that is standardized.

I noticed that, but assumed that simply reverting them without additional
work (such as tracking the string path) would be a no go given the reason
why they are reverted.

Well, if you think there is no other possibility for a default solution
(and tracking paths by default is not feasible) I think it might also be
alright if we expose the qid as a handle to Landlock (without any need for
mount options), and figure out a way for Landlock to keep a fid open.

I think if 9pfs export a handle it can be the full 64bit qid.path on any
platform, right?

I tried mounting a qemu-exported 9pfs backed on ext4, with
multidevs=remap, and created a file, used stat to note its inode number,
deleted the file, created another file (of the same OR different name),
and that new file will have the same inode number.

(If I don't delete the file, then a newly created file would of course
have a different ext4 inode number, and in that case QEMU exposes a
different qid)
