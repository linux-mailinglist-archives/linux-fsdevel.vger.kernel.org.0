Thanks for providing more background.

I have to say that this to me is wild. Essentially we're supposed to
allow access to our internal APIs based on internal use-cases that
aren't public and likely never will be.

If that's acceptable then I want bpf to document this in their kernel
Documentation and submit this for review to the wider community.
