Nit: this should be moved to patch #11

Also, perror(EUSERS) will display "Too many users" which is going to
be confusing.  I understand why you chose this; we would like to
distinguish between there are still inodes using this key, and there
are other users using this key.

Do we really need to return EUSERS in this case?  It's actually not an
*error* that other users are using the key.  After all, the unlink(2)
system call doesn't return an advisory error when you delete a file
which has other hard links.  And an application which does care about
this detail can always call FS_IOC_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS() and check
user_count.

Other than these nits, looks good.  Feel free to add:
