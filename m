Thanks for your feedback, response are below.

There is no specific attack vector I have in mind. The goal is to remove
mutable data, especially if it contains pointers, that could be used by
an attacker as a step in an exploit. See for example [0], [1].

Accidental can be any out-of-bounds write throughout the kernel.

It is still completely fine to modify the tables before registering,
like sysctl_route_net_init is doing. That code should not need any
changes.

Modifying the table inside the handler function would bypass the
validation done when registering so sounds like a bad idea in general.
It would still be possible however for a subsystem to do so by just not
making their sysctl table const and then modifying the table directly.

If the initial feedback to the RFC and general process is positive, yes.

Hopefully somebody comes up with a better name!

I managed to miss one change in my initial submission:
With the hunk below selftests and typing emails work.
