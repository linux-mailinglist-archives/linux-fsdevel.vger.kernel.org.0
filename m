Compression algorithms are somewhat "special".  The reference
implementation can often be imported as is with a few minor
modifications because if we're lucky it only really needs heap
alloc/free which we can provide.  The bigger problem is the use API. 
most compression algorithms eventually find themselves reimplemented in
many ways in many crypto systems even in userspace ... if zstd ever
gets standardized for compressed TLS, it will find itself wrappered in
openssl, for instance.  So, really, what the kernel is doing is no
different from what a lot of user space will do.

lib/zstd is ~300 lines of code, it's it doesn't seem to be that
difficult to maintain.  The bigger problem is that the "reference"
implementation is controlled by facebook and arbitrarily modified by
them to support their applications (Facebook isn't unique here, this
happens to a lot of reference implementations).  If you do a wc -l in
lib/ in the zstd repository it's ~74,000 lines.  So basically all we
care about is 0.4% of the supposed "reference" implementation.  Pulling
in the other 99.6% would serve no purpose other than to bloat our
attack surface, confuse the security analysis of the code and generate
a huge amount of static checking noise.

As I already think I demonstrated, we don't want or need 99.4% of the
upstream ... most of the changes if you read the commit log are in API
areas the core compression algorithm doesn't change that much.  An even
bigger problem is a lot of that API surface uses C library interfaces
we don't support so we'd either have to grow pointless support or find
a way of stripping them anyway.

The point I'm making is that in its current form we really, really
don't want to sync with upstream.  It would be really great if upstream
maintained a usable core of pure compression algorithms that we could
sync with, but it currently doesn't.

The above is also the rust crate problem in miniature: the crates grow
API features the kernel will never care about and importing them
wholesale is going to take forever because of the internal kernel
support issue.  In the end, to take rust async as an example, it will
be much better to do for rust what we've done for zlib: take the core
that can support the kernel threading model and reimplement that in the
kernel crate.  The act of doing that will a) prove people care enough
about the functionality and b) allow us to refine it nicely.

I also don't think rust would really want to import crates wholesale. 
The reason for no_std is that rust is trying to adapt to embedded
environments, which the somewhat harsh constraints of the kernel is
very similar to.

But the key point is if there were a reference core of just the bare
implementation separated from API wrappers, we could share it way more
easily.  It's not about having to import any old crap into the kernel,
it's about the maintainers of the reference implementation having to be
aware of all the possible uses of their code.

The counter example to everything you cite below is libxfs.  That's a
reference library that's shared between the xfs user space tools and
the kernel.  The point being that if you're willing to maintain just
the core of what you need in a style that's easily importable in
various environments, the task of importing it as the reference
implementation becomes easier.

I think the solution to the problem is to try to maintain highly mobile
reference implementations and also keep constantly considering what the
requirements are for mobility (both on the part of the reference
implementation and the kernel).  I also think that if we ever gave
impementors the magic ability just to dump any old code in the kernel,
they'd use it to take the lazy way out because it's a lot easier than
trying to keep the reference implementation separate.

The fact that most "reference" implementations don't conform to the
above isn't something we should be encouraging by supplying
compatibility APIs that paper over the problem and encourage API bloat.
