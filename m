My understanding was that on the disk the files' owner UID should be 
1000 always, while in the client side it will show file's owner as the 
mapped UID 0 with an idmapping 1000:0.

This should be the same as what you mentioned above, right ?

As you know the cephfs MDSs will use the creation requests' caller UID 
as the owner's UID when creating new inodes.

Which means that if the creation requests switches to use the mapped UID 
0 as the caller UID then the file's owner will be UID 0 instead of UID 
1000 in cephfs MDSs. Does this what this patch want to do ?

If my understanding is correct above, then when opening the file with 
non-mapped UID 1000 it may fail because the files' owner is UID 0.

Correct me if my understanding is wrong.

Yeah, this was also what I thought it should be.

There is another client auth feature [1] for cephfs. The MDS will allow 
us to set a path restriction for specify UID, more detail please see [2]:

 Â allow rw path=/dir1 uid=1000 gids=1000

This may cause the creation requests to fail if you set the caller UID 
to the mapped UID.
