Totally agree - from the ancient history of LSF (before MM or BPF!) we 
also pushed for discussions over talks.

Local file systems like xfs running on "scale up" giant systems (think 
of the old super sized HP Superdomes and the like) would be likely to 
handle this well.

In a lot of ways, ngnfs means to replicate that scalability for "scale 
out" (hate buzz words!) systems that are more affordable. In effect, you 
can size your system by just adding more servers with their local NVME 
devices and build up performance and capacity in an incremental way.

Shared disk file systems like scoutfs which (also GPL'ed but not 
upstream) scale pretty well in file count but have coarse grain locking 
that causes performance bumps and the added complexity of needed RAID 
heads or SAN systems.

All of ngnfs is GPL'ed - no non-open source client or similar.
