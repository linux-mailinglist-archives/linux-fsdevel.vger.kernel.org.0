I guess no point in you wasting time for this. But if you'd try, I'll
really find out it isn't so easy. Inotify event is fixed length so
fsid+fhandle is completely out of the realm of "easy extension". If you
wanted to return fd instead of wd, that would be doable with some kind of a
flag in the mark mask, although it would be a bit inconsistent with the
rest of the inotify API.

Well yes, fanotify could have been designed to make basic usage easier. But
the design (some 15 years ago) was focusing more on filling in the
functional gaps inotify had for usecases such as anti-virus monitors etc.
and kind of left thinking about simple usecases for sometime later.
So we have what we have.
