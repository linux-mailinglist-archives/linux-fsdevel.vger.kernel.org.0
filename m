I don't think this deserves a custom taint, and TAINT_USER should be the
one to add here, as it clearly communicates what's being done at this
point. If we cannot compromise on utilizing it, then lets just forget
about forcing any other flag at this point. As per tracking which
taint flags a user has forced via this interface, I do have another
idea that I still have to iron out, but I'll propose it soon enough.

OK.
