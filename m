In the paragraph above the fallback logic, use the shorter phrasing

+IOCTL support
+-------------
+
+The ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` access right restricts the use of
+:manpage:`ioctl(2)`, but it only applies to newly opened files.  This mean=
s
+specifically that pre-existing file descriptors like stdin, stdout and std=
err
+are unaffected.
+
+Users should be aware that TTY devices have traditionally permitted to con=
trol
+other processes on the same TTY through the ``TIOCSTI`` and ``TIOCLINUX`` =
IOCTL
+commands.  It is therefore recommended to close inherited TTY file descrip=
tors,
+or to reopen them from ``/proc/self/fd/*`` without the
+``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` right, if possible.  The :manpage:`isatty(3)`
+function checks whether a given file descriptor is a TTY.
+
+Landlock's IOCTL support is coarse-grained at the moment, but may become m=
ore
+fine-grained in the future.  Until then, users are advised to establish th=
e
+guarantees that they need through the file hierarchy, by only permitting t=
he
+``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL`` right on files where it is really harmless.  =
In
+cases where you can control the mounts, the ``nodev`` mount option can hel=
p to
+rule out that device files can be accessed.
