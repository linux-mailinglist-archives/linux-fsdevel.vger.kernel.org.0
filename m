Ping. If someone can see how we can avoid making do_linkat() callers
ensure the process has CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability if AT_EMPTY_PATH
was passed then the hints would be really appreciated.

The best I could come up with is something like getname_linkat(), which
could be used by the do_linkat callers, but this sounds error prone and
ugly.

Jens, do you want to keep the mkdir change out of 5.13 because of this?
