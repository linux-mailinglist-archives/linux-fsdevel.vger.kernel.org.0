Well I didn't claimed that this would be easy, we juts need to start 
somewhere.

Regarding the sparse file handling, how about using 
file->f_mapping->nrpages as badness for shmem files?

That should give us the real number of pages allocated through this 
shmem file and gracefully handles sparse files.

Well, what is so bad at the approach of giving each process holding a 
reference to some shared memory it's equal amount of badness even when 
the processes belong to different memory control groups?

If you really think that this would be a hard problem for upstreaming we 
could as well keep the behavior for memcg as it is for now. We would 
just need to adjust the paramters to oom_badness() a bit.

Christian.
