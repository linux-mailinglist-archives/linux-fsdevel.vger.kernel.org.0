Hah, if we add a simple idle "feature" like

for (i=0;i<1000000;i+) {;}

and it would destroy all the performance, let's throw useless
Linux kernel then!

If seriously, it's more of an open question to me, how much overhead
it adds if enabled (with typical filters/options/etc).

Btw, do you really need two hooks -- before and right after
execution?
