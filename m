This patch going into staging doesn't necessarily mean that one day
it'll get moved to fs/exfat/. It's very possible that the approach would
instead be to use the staging code for reference, build this
functionality in fs/fat/, and kill off the staging code when it's not
needed anymore.

With regards to missing specs/docs/whatever - our main concern with this
release was that we want full interoperability, which is why the spec
was made public as-is without modifications from what was used
internally. There's no "secret sauce" that Microsoft is hiding here.

How about we give this spec/code time to get soaked and reviewed for a
bit, and if folks still feel (in a month or so?) that there are missing
bits of information related to exfat, I'll be happy to go back and try
to get them out as well.
