Yes, please!

XFS was designed and implemented on an OS that gave this exact
guarantee for kernel allocations back in the early 1990s.  Memory
allocation simply blocked until it succeeded unless the caller
indicated they could handle failure. That's what __GFP_NOFAIL does
and XFS is still heavily dependent on this behaviour.

And before people scream "but that was 30 years ago, Unix OS code
was much simpler", consider that Irix supported machines with
hundreds of NUMA nodes, thousands of CPUs, terabytes of memory and
petabytes of storage. It had variable size high order pages in the
page cache (something we've only just got with folios!), page
migration, page compaction, memory and process locality control,
filesystem block sizes larger than page size (which we don't have
yet!), memory shrinkers for subsystem cache reclaim, page cache
dirty throttling to sustained writeback IO rates, etc.

Lots of the mm technology from that OS has been re-implemented in
Linux in the past two decades, but in several important ways Linux
still falls shy of the bar that Irix set a couple of decades ago.
One of those is the kernel memory allocation guarantee.

This is the sort of thing I was thinking of in the "remove
GFP_NOFS" discussion thread when I said this to Kent:

	"We need to start designing our code in a way that doesn't require
	extensive testing to validate it as correct. If the only way to
	validate new code is correct is via stochastic coverage via error
	injection, then that is a clear sign we've made poor design choices
	along the way."

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/ZcqWh3OyMGjEsdPz@dread.disaster.area/

If memory allocation doesn't fail by default, then we can remove the
vast majority of allocation error handling from the kernel. Make the
common case just work - remove the need for all that code to handle
failures that is hard to exercise reliably and so are rarely tested.

A simple change to make long standing behaviour an actual policy we
can rely on means we can remove both code and test matrix overhead -
it's a win-win IMO.

Cheers,

Dave.
