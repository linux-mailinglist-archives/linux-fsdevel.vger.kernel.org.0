From a source code perspective, I like the idea of cleaning up the
function signature to pass fewer things to ->iomap_begin.  I suspect
that we could simplify it to:

	int (*iomap_begin)(const struct iomap_iter *iter,
			   struct iomap *iomap,
			   struct iomap *srcmap);

That way we preserve the notion that the ->iomap_begin functions aren't
allowed to change the iterator contents except for the two iomaps.

That said, the nice thing about passing so many parameters is that it
probably leads to less pointer chasing in the implementation functions.
I wonder if that makes any difference because extent mapping lookups
likely involve a lot more pointer chasing anyway.  Another benefit is
that since the parameters aren't const, each implementation can (re)use
those variables if they need to.

I think you could simplify iomap_end too:

	int (*iomap_end)(const struct iomap_iter *iter,
			 loff_t pos, u64 length,
			 size_t written);

and make ->iomap_end implementations extract iter->flags and iter->iomap
themselves if they want to.  I don't like how xfs_iomap.c abuses
container_of to extract the iter from the iomap pointer.

(But not enough to have written patches fixing any of this. :P)

Yes, it's quite possible to push the iomap iteration control down into
the filesystems to avoid the indirect calls.  That might make things
faster, though I have no idea what sort of performance impact that will
have.

OTOH making it easier for non-disk filesystems to use iomap but supply
their own IO mechanism (transformed bios, memcpy, etc) makes a far more
compelling argument for doing this painful(?) treewide change IMO.
