Thanks for your reply, we checked several fixes in wb_workfn , and 
finally found

this patch (ceff86fddae8 ext4: Avoid freeing inodes on dirty list) works.

Our fsstressÂ  process randomly uses ioctl interface to set inode with 
journal data flag, ext4 inode with journal data

flags is possible to be marked dirty and added to writeback lists again.

When locked_inode_to_wb_and_lock_list in __mark_inode_dirty releases 
inode->i_lock and do not lock

wb->list_lock, simultaneously the inode is evicted and removed from 
writeback lists, it's possible this

inode will be added to writeback list again. This problem causes inode 
allocated from slab is still on

writeback list, and may causes crash because destory_inode set inode->wb 
to be NULL.
