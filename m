But that is a task_work to the helper thread correct?

I can see that.

Which leaves me with the question do these task_work's directly wake up
the thread that submitted the I/O request?   Or is there likely to be
something for an I/O thread to do before an ordinary program thread is
notified.

I am asking because it is only the case of notifying ordinary program
threads that is interesting in the case of a coredump.  As I understand
it a data to read notification would typically be handled by the I/O
uring worker thread to trigger reading the data before letting userspace
know everything it asked to be done is complete.
