The change looks all right to me.

Acked-by: Peter Xu <peterx@redhat.com>

For the long term maybe we want to cleanup a bit on the VM_FAULT_* entries,
e.g., here VM_FAULT_RETRY doesn't really mean "we should retry the fault"
but instead only the hint to show that we'ver released the mmap lock when
any error is set.

Meanwhile it's also not the only one to express that because now we also
have VM_FAULT_COMPLETED, so it's debatable which one we should use here
purely from the logic and definition of the retvals.

One thing we can make this slightly cleaner in the future is we can have a
flag sololy for "we have released the mmap lock", so fundamentally we can
consider renaming COMPLETE->MM_RELEASED, then we use RETRY to only hint
"whether we really want to retry" and leave "whether mmap lock released"
for the new flag.

It could look like:

  MM_RELEASED    (new) RETRY
  0              0             -> page fault resolved (old "retval=0")
  0              1             -> retry with mmap held (currently invalid, so let's ignore this)
  1              0             -> resolved and lock released (old COMPLETE)
  1              1             -> lock releaesd,need to retry (old RETRY)

Then IIUC for error cases we can return MM_RELEASED|ERROR for whatever
error (without setting RETRY).

Not sure whether it helps in any form.  Even if it would, it can definitely
be done on top.

Thanks,
