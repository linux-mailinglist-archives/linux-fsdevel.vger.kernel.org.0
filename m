>>>> Given that CXL memory devices can potentially cover a wide range of technologies with quite different latency and bandwidth metrics, will one zone serve as the management vehicle that you seek? If a system contains both CXL attached DRAM and, let say, a byte-addressable CXL SSD - both used as (different) byte addressable tiers in a tiered memory hierarchy, allocating memory from the ZONE_EXMEM doesnât really tell you much about what you get. So the client would still need an orthogonal method to characterize the desired performance characteristics. This method could be combined with a fabric independent zone such as ZONE_PREFER_MOVABLE to address the kernel allocation issue. At the same time, this new zone could also be useful in other cases, such as virtio-mem.
