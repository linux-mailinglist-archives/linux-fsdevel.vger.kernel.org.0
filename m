It's the fact that it actually was in a form that could be merged, no
one has done that with the sdfat code :)

What fixes?  That's what I'm asking here.

How do we "know" that this is better than what we currently have today?
We don't, so it's a bit hard to tell someone, "delete the work you did
and replace it with this other random chunk of code, causing you a bunch
more work in the process for no specific reason other than it looks
'newer'." :(

Are they going to do this if we do take the sdfat code?  If so, great,
but I need to get someone to agree that this will happen.

They are more than willing to start contributing and being a
co-maintainer of it, it needs all the help it can get.

But "someone" from samsung, or anywhere else, has to be willing to step
up here and do this work.  Without that happening, I don't see a reason
to change at this point in time.

Rembember, kernel development happens because people do the work, which
Valdis did, and continues to do.  Throwing that away because of the
thought that someone else might do some work in the future is not how we
work.

I recommend looking at what we have in the tree now, and seeing what is
missing compared to "sdfat".  I know a lot of places in the exfat code
that needs to be fixed up, odds are they are the same stuff that needs
to be resolved in sdfat as well.

thanks,
