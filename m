Pavel,

I cannot comment on the merit of the proposed hack but my proposed
patch to fix the coredump truncation issue when a process using
io_uring core dumps that I submitted back in August is still
unreviewed!

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1625bc89782bf83d9d8c7c63e8ffcb651ccb15fa.1629655338.git.olivier@trillion01.com/

I have been using it since then I must have generated many dozens of
perfect core dump files with it and I have not seen a single truncated
core dump files like I used to have prior to the patch.

I am bringing back my patch to your attention because one nice side
effect of it is that it would have avoided totally the problem that you
have encountered in coredump_wait() since it does cancel io_uring
resources before calling coredump_wait()!

Greetings,
Olivier
