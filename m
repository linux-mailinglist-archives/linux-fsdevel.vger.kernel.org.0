TBH, my main problem with this is that ESTALE retry logics had never
felt right.  We ask e.g. filename_create() to get us the parent.  We
tell it whether we want it to be maximally suspicious or not.  It
still does the same RCU-normal-LOOKUP_REVAL sequence, only for "trust
no one" variant it's RCU-LOOKUP_REVAL-LOOKUP_REVAL instead.  We are
*not* told how far in that sequence did it have to get.  What's more,
even if we had to get all way up to LOOKUP_REVAL, we ignore that
when we do dcache lookup for the last component - only the argument
of filename_create() is looked at.

It really smells like the calling conventions are wrong.  I agree that
all of that is, by definition, a very slow path - it's just that the
logics makes me go "WTF?" every time I see it... ;-/

Hell knows - perhaps the lookup_flags thing wants to be passed by
reference (all the way into path_parentat()) and have the "we had
to go for LOOKUP_REVAL" returned that way.  Not sure...

Al, still crawling out of the bloody ptrace/asm glue horrors at the moment...
