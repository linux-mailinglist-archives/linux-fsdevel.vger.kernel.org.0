My point is that the capable logic will walk upwards the user namespace
hierarchy from the token->userns until the user namespace of the caller
and terminate when it reached the init_user_ns.

A caller is located in some namespace at the point where they call this
function. They provided a token. The caller isn't capable in the
namespace of the token so the function falls back to init_user_ns. Two
interesting cases:

(1) The caller wasn't in an ancestor userns of the token. If that's the
    case then it follows that the caller also wasn't in the init_user_ns
    because the init_user_ns is a descendant of all other user
    namespaces. So falling back will fail.

(2) The caller was in the same or an ancestor user namespace of the
    token but didn't have the capability in that user namespace:
    
     (i) They were in a non-init_user_ns. Therefore they can't be
         privileged in init_user_ns.
    (ii) They were in init_user_ns. Therefore, they lacked privileges in
         the init_user_ns.
    
In both cases your fallback will do nothing iiuc.
