Right, pagetable memory is interesting since it's something that any 
random kernel user can indirectly allocate via iommu_domain_alloc() and 
iommu_map(), and some of those users may even be doing so on behalf of 
userspace. I have no objection to accounting and potentially applying 
limits to *that*.

Beyond that, though, there is nothing special about "the IOMMU 
subsystem". The amount of memory an IOMMU driver needs to allocate for 
itself in order to function is not of interest beyond curiosity, it just 
is what it is; limiting it would only break the IOMMU, and if a user 
thinks it's "too much", the only actionable thing that might help is to 
physically remove devices from the system. Similar for DMA buffers; it 
might be intriguing to account those, but it's not really an actionable 
metric - in the overwhelming majority of cases you can't simply tell a 
driver to allocate less than what it needs. And that is of course 
assuming if we were to account *all* DMA buffers, since whether they 
happen to have an IOMMU translation or not is irrelevant (we'd have 
already accounted the pagetables as pagetables if so).

I bet "the networking subsystem" also consumes significant memory on the 
same kind of big systems where IOMMU pagetables would be of any concern. 
I believe some of the some of the "serious" NICs can easily run up 
hundreds of megabytes if not gigabytes worth of queues, SKB pools, etc. 
- would you propose accounting those too?

Thanks,
Robin.
