I would say "...changes ext4 to allocate in units of multiple fs blocks,
also known as clusters." so that the definition of a cluster is right
there in the first sentence instead of the second.

I think the documentation should say exactly what the untorn write
geometry is constrained to:

"EXT4 supports multi-fsblock atomic writes with bigalloc, subject to the
following constraints: The minimum atomic write size is the larger of
the fs block size and the minimum hardware atomic write unit; and the
maximum atomic write size is smaller of the bigalloc cluster size and
the maximum hardware atomic write unit.  Bigalloc ensures that all
allocations are aligned to the cluster size, which satisfies the LBA
alignment requirements of the hardware device if the start of the
partition/logical volume is itself aligned correctly."

Might want to add at least a sentence about "figure out what atomic
write unit your application needs by querying statx of the block device
or whatever.  Or refer them to the "Hardware Support" section. :)

The rest fits with my understanding of atomic untorn writes.
