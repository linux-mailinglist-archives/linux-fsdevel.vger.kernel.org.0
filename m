Submitting a copy operation as two bios or two requests means that there 
is a risk that one of the two operations never reaches the block driver
at the bottom of the storage stack and hence that a deadlock occurs. I
prefer not to introduce any mechanisms that can cause a deadlock.

As one can see here, Damien Le Moal and Keith Busch both prefer to
submit copy operations as a single operation: Keith Busch, Re: [PATCH
v20 02/12] Add infrastructure for copy offload in block and request
layer, linux-block mailing list, 2024-06-24

Such information wouldn't have to be maintained inside the sd driver. A
new kernel module could be introduced that tracks the state of copy
operations and that interacts with the sd driver.

If a single copy operation takes significantly more time than the time
required to switch between power states, power can be saved by using
IMMED=1. Mechanisms like run-time power management (RPM) or the UFS host
controller auto-hibernation mechanism can only be activated if no
commands are in progress. With IMMED=0, the link between the host and
the storage device will remain powered as long as the copy operation is
in progress. With IMMED=1, the link between the host and the storage
device can be powered down after the copy operation has been submitted
until the host decides to check whether or not the copy operation has
completed.

I don't know of any storage device vendor who has implemented all
EXTENDED COPY features that have been standardized. Assuming that 50
lines of code fit on a single page, here is an example of an EXTENDED
COPY implementation that can be printed on 21 pages of paper:
$ wc -l drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c
  1041
$ echo $(((1041 + 49) / 50))
21

The advantages of EXTENDED COPY over ODX are as follows:
- EXTENDED COPY is a single SCSI command and hence better suited for
   devices with a limited queue depth. While the UFS 3.0 standard
   restricts the queue depth to 32, most UFS 4.0 devices support a
   queue depth of 64.
- The latency of setting up a copy command with EXTENDED COPY is
   lower since only a single command has to be sent to the device.
   ODX requires three round-trips to the device (assuming IMMED=0).
- EXTENDED COPY requires less memory in storage devices. Each ODX
   token occupies some memory and the rules around token lifetimes
   are nontrivial.

Thanks,

Bart.
