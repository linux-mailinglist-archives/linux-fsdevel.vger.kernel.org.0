The results look nice for sure. Once concern is that io_uring generally
guarantees that any state passed in is stable once submit is done. For
the below implementation, that doesn't hold as the linux_dirent64 isn't
used until later in the process. That means if you do:

submit_getdents64(ring)
{
	struct linux_dirent64 dent;
	struct io_uring_sqe *sqe;

	sqe = io_uring_get_sqe(ring);
	io_uring_prep_getdents64(sqe, ..., &dent);
	io_uring_submit(ring);
}

other_func(ring)
{
	struct io_uring_cqe *cqe;

	submit_getdents64(ring);
	io_uring_wait_cqe(ring, &cqe);
	
}

then the kernel side might get garbage by the time the sqe is actually
submitted. This is true because you don't use it inline, only from the
out-of-line async context. Usually this is solved by having the prep
side copy in the necessary state, eg see io_openat2_prep() for how we
make filename and open_how stable by copying them into kernel memory.
That ensures that if/when these operations need to go async and finish
out-of-line, the contents are stable and there's no requirement for the
application to keep them valid once submission is done.

Not sure how best to solve that, since the vfs side relies heavily on
linux_dirent64 being a user pointer...

Outside of that, implementation looks straight forward.
