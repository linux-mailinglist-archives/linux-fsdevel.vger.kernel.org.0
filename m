FYI, I tested kernel 5.10.59 + backport 06af8679449d + the patch above
with my io_uring program.  The coredump locked up even when writing the
core file directly to disk; the zombie process could not be killed with
"kill -9".  Unfortunately I can't test with newer kernels without
spending some time on it, and I am too busy with other stuff right now.

My io_uring program does async buffered reads
(io_uring_prep_read()/io_uring_prep_readv()) from a raw disk partition
(no filesystem).  One thread submits I/Os while another thread calls
io_uring_wait_cqe() and processes the completions.  To trigger the
coredump, I added an intentional abort() in the thread that submits I/Os
after running for a second.
