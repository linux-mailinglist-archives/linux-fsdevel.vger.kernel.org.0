Actually it should be pretty simple as I imagine it. Maybe I can quickly
hack a POC.

You're right that for open_by_handle_at() the fsid is actually only good
for getting *any* path on the superblock where file handle can be used so
any of the fsids provided by btrfs is OK. What will be a slight catch is
that if you would be using name_to_handle_at() to match what you've got
from fanotify you will never be able to identify some fids. I'm not sure
how serious that would be...
