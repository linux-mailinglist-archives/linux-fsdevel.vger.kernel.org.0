I would hope that we wouldn't introduce ptrace to io_uring, because
unless we plan to attach to io_uring events via GDB it's simply the
wrong tool for the job. strace does use ptrace, but that's mostly
because Linux's dynamic tracing was still in its infancy at the time
(and even today it requires more privileges than ptrace) -- but you can
emulate strace using bpftrace these days fairly easily.

So really what is being asked here is "can we make it possible to debug
io_uring programs as easily as traditional I/O programs". And this does
not require ptrace, nor should ptrace be part of this discussion IMHO. I
believe this issue (along with seccomp-style filtering) have been
mentioned informally in the past, but I am happy to finally see a thread
about this appear.

io_uring was introduced in Linux 5.1, predating clone3() and openat2().
My larger concern is that io_uring operations aren't extensible-structs
-- but we can resolve that issue with some slight ugliness if we ever
run into the problem.

I imagine because using the syscall requires specific memory barriers
which we probably don't want most C programs to be fiddling with
directly. Sort of similar to how iptables doesn't have a syscall-style
man page.

Unless I misunderstood the patch cover-letter, Stefano's proposal is to
have a mechanism for adding restrictions to individual io_urings -- so
we still need a separate mechanism (or an extended version of Stefano's
proposal) to allow for the "reduce attack surface" usecase of seccomp.
It seems to me like Stefano's proposal is more related to cases where
you might SCM_RIGHTS-send an io_uring to an unprivileged process.

We could just emulate the seccomp-bpf API with the pseudo-syscalls done
as a result of CQEs, though I'm not sure how happy folks will be with
this kind of glue code in "seccomp-uring" (though in theory it would
allow us to attach existing filters to io_uring...).
