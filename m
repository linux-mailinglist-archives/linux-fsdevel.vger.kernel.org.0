That is very interesting. Like Olivier mentioned, it's not that actual
commit, but rather the change of behavior implemented by it. Before that
commit, we'd hit the async workers more often, whereas after we do the
correct retry method where it's driven by the wakeup when the page is
unlocked. This is purely speculation, but perhaps the fact that the
process changes state potentially mid dump is why the dump ends up being
truncated?

I'd love to dive into this and try and figure it out. Absent a test
case, at least the above gives me an idea of what to try out. I'll see
if it makes it easier for me to create a case that does result in a
truncated core dump.
