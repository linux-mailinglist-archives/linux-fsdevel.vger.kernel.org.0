LSFMM happened last week so with travel and conference there simply was
no time to rebase. It should be ready for merging once rebased.

Rebasing the patchset is _massively_ painful which is why in the cover
letter to it I requested that patches which is why I requested
that currently pending patchsets that touch the same code please be
applied on top of it. (I'm happy to apply them manually on top of my
branch.)

In any case, I'll have a rebased version ready on Monday (If there's no
urgent issues I have to address somewhere else that I missed during
travel.)
