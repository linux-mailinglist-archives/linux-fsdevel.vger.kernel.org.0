Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Holo Lambert, a Lawyer by profession. I am the personal
attorney to Engr. Zhang, a national of your country, who used to work
with Chevron Oil Exploration Company in Angola, herein after shall be
referred to as my client.

On the September 27, 2016, my client was involved in a helicopter
Crash, and died en route to the company=E2=80=99s Tombua-Landana facility i=
n
Angola.

Since then I have made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any
of my clients extended relatives over there. This has proved
unsuccessful. I came to know about you through an inquiry I was making
on the internet, and I found out you shared the same surname with my
client, which is why I have decided to contact you, in order to assist
in repatriating his funds and property left behind my office desk
before they get confiscated or declared serviceable by the bank.

Please get in touch with me if you wish to collaborate with me.
(hololambert@protonmail.com)

Best regards,

Mr. Holo.
