Thanks, Amir.  This sounds right.

Agreed.

Sigh

With  SB_I_IMA_UNVERIFIABLE_SIGNATURE enabled for overlayfs, signature
verification will then fail immediately for all overlayfs files in
policy.  I don't think that's the right solution.  Verification should
be limited to when the overlayfs file is the same as the underlying
backing store, the real inode, not the overlay upper files.
