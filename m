There's no point. Userspace relies on the current meaning of triple
slashes. It really does.

I know many places in systemd where we might end up with a triple
slash. Here's a real-life example: some code wants to access the
cgroup attribute 'cgroup.controllers' of the root cgroup. It thus
generates the right path in the fs for it, which is the concatenation of
"/sys/fs/cgroup/" (because that's where cgroupfs is mounted), of "/"
(i.e. for the root cgroup) and of "/cgroup.controllers" (as that's the
file the attribute is exposed under).

And there you go:

   "/sys/fs/cgroup/" + "/" + "/cgroup.controllers" â†’ "/sys/fs/cgroup///cgroup.controllers"

This is a real-life thing. Don't break this please.
