Can you elaborate what it will benefit us if we only support one tail
block for iomap_read_inline_data()? (I mean it has similar LOC changes,
similar implementation / complexity.) The only concern I think is if
it causes gfs2 regression, so that is what I'd like to confirm.

In contrast, I'd like to avoid iomap_write_begin() tail-packing because
it's complex and no fs user interests in it for now. So I leave it
untouched for now.

Another concern I really like to convert EROFS to iomap is I'd like to
support sub-page blocksize for EROFS after converting. I don't want to
touch iomap inline code again like this since it interacts 2 directories
thus cause too much coupling.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
