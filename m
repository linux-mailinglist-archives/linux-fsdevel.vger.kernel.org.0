io_uring also supports a NOP command, which basically just measures
reqs/sec through the interface. Ran that as well:

Kernel		SQPOLL		IOPS		Perf diff
---------------------------------------------------------
5.13		0		31.05M		0.0%
5.13 + audit	0		25.31M		-18.5%

and profile for the latter includes:

+    5.19%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_uring_entry
+    4.31%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_uring_exit
     0.26%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_syscall_entry
     0.08%  io_uring  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] __audit_syscall_exit
