My Good Friend

I'm deeply sorry to berg into your privacy as we haven't met before,
as a matter of fact, I will be very brief since I'm in urgent need of
a trust person to help move out a valuable funds deposit by later
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi into a foreign bank account which will
later be used for any profitable joint investment between me and you,

as a civil servant i cannot do this alone, The Libya=E2=80=99s sovereign
wealth fund said five EU countries paid out money from frozen accounts
in Europe that once belonged to Muammar Qaddafi despite international
sanctions, according to POLITICO.

But no one are aware of this Total Amount is $19.5 Million us Dollars
that currently available under QNB Fineness bank Turkey and placed in
an ESCROW CALL ACCOUNT without a beneficiary, it will be of advantage
for me to solicit for a foreigner on my behalf since the funds origin
is from a genuine source. Total Amount is $19.5 Million us Dollars.

ions-under-Qaddafi-abroad-and-who-benefits-from-them-

For more details kindly indicate your willingness by responding via my
