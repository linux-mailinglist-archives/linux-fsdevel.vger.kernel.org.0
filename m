I will definitely look at it this week. Although I don't like the idea
to have a new kthread. We already have an application thread and have
the fuse server thread, why do we need another one?

Well, Ming Lei is working on that for ublk_drv and I guess that new approach
could be adapted as well onto the current way of io-uring.
It _probably_ wouldn't work with IORING_OP_READV/IORING_OP_WRITEV.

I need to check, but really, the majority of the new additions
is just to set up things, shutdown and to have sanity checks.
Request sending/completing to/from the ring is not that much new lines.


Thanks,
