After discussing this a bit with Jens at lpc, he's not a fan of the
pinning idea for fixed buffers, so for v2 I am going to abandon this
and instead just do the lookup every time.

This ends up making the discussion below irrelevant, but adding my
comments below anyways for completeness.

I think we would still need to account for the

The way I view it is that conceptually, userspace "owns" the buffer.
Userspace allocated the buffer and is later responsible for freeing it
when it's done using it. When userspace registers the buffer to the
ring, it can expect the buffer to be written to / read from by the
kernel code, but it should also be able to expect that when it
unregisters the buffer from the ring and any of the concurrent
inflight requests are fulfilled, the kernel will not be accessing that
buffer anymore and userspace has complete sovereignty over the buffer.

With fuse continuing to hold the reference on the buffer (for the
lifetime of the connection) and continuing to read to / write from it
after unregistration, that violates that contract.

Yes, I think the difference is that returning -EBUSY signals to the
caller that the buffer cannot be unregistered and will still be used.
Whereas succeeding but not actually releasing the buffer resource and
still continuing to use it beyond the inflight cmds is
contrary/deceptive behavior to what the user should be able to expect.

I don't think this is likely. I think it's more likely that a
high-performance fuse server would use a separate ring for
non-fuse-related I/O, as doing it on the same ring it's using to
communicate with the fuse kernel would lead to more contention for
ring entries which would result in higher latency for servicing
incoming/outgoing fuse requests. I guess the caller could make the
ring very big to accommodate for that, but then that leads to more
memory overhead (eg allocating the headers buffers for all the
potential entries).
