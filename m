Any file in /proc is not reliable. You can't guarantee, the pid you need
at restore time will be free. Simple example: a program reading information
about its threads. It can't believe /proc/XXX/task/YYY/ after restore,
any access will results in error. The same is with other files in /proc.
Why do you require additional guarantees from the only directory in /proc?
This is really strange approach.

The issue is already fixed, and the fix is called pid namespace.

Did you get my proposition? Any container will rename namespaces like it wants
in its own /proc. Current patchset does not contain this, but I wrote this in
replies. Maybe you missed that.

This is not expedient. You can't reliable restore certain pid in the same pid namespace,
which is very likely used information.

But you request this strange functionality from rare used /proc/namespaces,
which is only for system utils. This is really strange and useless.

Hierarchy during user namespace is completely crap IMO. The world does not
spinning around CRIU. It will be really strange to analyze container net
namespaces topology (say, where veth is connected) iterating over user
namespaces directories. What is this information for? Nobody needs it.
It is just bad design and ugly interface, which makes users to say curses
for inventor of such the interface.

I don't give more guarantees, than guarantees during pid restore.
What do you have on restore w/o pid namespace now?! If there is free pid,
you restore you program with this pid number. Otherwise, you restore with
another pid, or do not restore. The same is with namespace aliases. No more.

Nope. Namespaces are not grouped by user namespace hierarchy. Pid and
user namespace use their own parent/child grouping, all another namespaces
types are linked in double linked lists.
