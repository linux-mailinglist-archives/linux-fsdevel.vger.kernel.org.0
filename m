I think we're still at the "making sure everything works" stage.

I'll try to keep Rust optional a release or two, more so that we can
iron out any toolchain hiccups, and in that period we'll be looking for
non critical stuff to transition to Rust (the debugfs code, most
likely).

When we make Rust a hard dependency kernel side will have to be a topic
of discussion - but Rust is already a hard dependency on the userspace
side, in -tools, so the lack of full architecture support is definitely
something I'm hoping get addressed sooner rather than later, but it's
probably not the blocker here.

As soon as we're ok with making Rust a hard dependency kernel side,
we'll be looking at switching a lot of stuff to Rust (e.g. fsck).

I didn't see that comment, but we're mainly looking at what we can do
inside fs/bcachefs/, and I've already got Rust bindings for the btree
interface (that I talked about in a meeting with you guys, actually)
that we'll be pulling in soon.

You mean a new, from scratch bcachefs module? Sorry, but that would not
be practical :)

Wedson's work is on my radar too - that opens up a lot of possibilities.
But right now my goal is just to get /some/ Rust code into bcachefs,
and make sure we can incrementally bring in more Rust code within the same
module.

Oh? This is exactly what I said we were going to do at the conference :)

Happy to meet though, let's figure out a time that works for Thomas too.

Cheers,
Kent
