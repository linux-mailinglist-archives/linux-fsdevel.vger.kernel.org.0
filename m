There may be a misunderstanding

audit_start(req)
ret = io_issue_sqe(req);
audit_end(ret);

io_issue_sqe() may return 0 but leave the request inflight,
which will be completed asynchronously e.g. by IRQ, not going
through io_issue_sqe() or any io_read()/etc helpers again, and
after last audit_end() had already happened.
That's the case with read/write/timeout, but is not true for
open/etc.

Ok, good
