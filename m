Hello Christian,

Thanks for the answers.

A couple of small queries still below.

I suppose that I should have clarified that my main problem was
that you were using the word "filesystem" in a way that I find
unconventional/ambiguous. I mean, I normally take the term
"filesystem" to be "a storage system for folding files".
Here, you are using "filesystem" to mean something else, what 
I might call like "the single directory hierarchy" or "the
filesystem hierarchy" or "the list of mount points".

I'm not against the word "detached". To user space, I think it is a
little more meaningful than "anonymous". For the moment, I'll stay with
"detached", but if you insist on "anonymous", I'll probably change it.

I like that text *a lot* better! Thanks very much for suggesting
wordings. It makes my life much easier. 

I've made the text:

       EINVAL The mount that is to be ID mapped is not a detached
              mount; that is, the mount has not previously been
              visible in a mount namespace.

And that too! I've made the text:

       â€¢  The mount must be a detached mount; that is, it must have
          been created by calling open_tree(2) with the
          OPEN_TREE_CLONE flag and it must not already have been
          visible in a mount namespace.  (To put things another way:
          the mount must not have been attached to the filesystem
          hierarchy with a system call such as move_mount(2).)

Fair enough.

D'oh! Okay. I hadn't considered that use case for an invalid dirfd.
(And now I've done some adjustments to openat(2),which contains a
rationale for the *at() functions.)

So, now I understand your purpose, but still the code is obscure,
since

* You use a magic value (-EBADF) rather than (say) -1.
* There's no explanation (comment about) of the fact that you want
  to prevent relative pathnames.

So, I've changed the code to use -1, not -EBADF, and I've added some
comments to explain that the intent is to prevent relative pathnames.
Okay?

But, there is still the meta question: what's the problem with using
a relative pathname?

I made the same change as above.
