We had a bit of discussion with Ming about that last year, besides that
I got busy with other parts, it got a bit less of personal interest for
me as our project really needs to access the buffer (additional
checksums, sending it out over network library (libfabric), possibly
even preprocessing of some data) - I think it makes sense if I work on
the other fuse parts first and only come back zero copy a bit later.

I wasn't in contact with that customer personally, I had just seen their
email.It would probably help if RHEL would eventually gain io-uring
support - almost all of HPC systems are using it or a clone. I was
always hoping that RHEL would get it before I'm done with
fuse-over-io-uring, now I'm not so sure anymore.


Thanks,
