Follows the ublk splice-zc branch:

https://github.com/ming1/ubdsrv/commits/splice-zc

which is mentioned in cover letter, but I guess it should be added to
here too, sorry for that, so far only ublk-loop supports it by:

   ublk add -t loop -f $BACKING -z

without '-z', ublk-loop is created with zero copy disabled.

tag is one attribute of io request, which is originated from ublk
driver, and it is unique for each request among one queue. So ublksrv
won't change it at all, just use it, and ublk driver guarantees that
it is unique.

In ublkserv implementation, the tag info is set in cqe->user_data, so
we can retrieve the io request via tag part of cqe->user_data.

Also I may not understand your question of 'the relation between tag and right
CQE order', io_uring provides IOSQE_IO_DRAIN/IOSQE_IO_LINK for ordering
SQE, and ublksrv only applies IOSQE_IO_LINK in ublk-qcow2, so care to
explain it in a bit details about the "the relation between tag and right
CQE order"?

Thanks,
Ming
