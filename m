Not sure, need to find some time to work on this!

Hmm, if you transfer the fd to someone else, you also give them access
to your credentials etc. We could make that -EPERM, if the owner of the
ring isn't the one invoking the submit. But that doesn't really help the
SQPOLL case, which simply consumes SQE entries. There can be no checking
there.
