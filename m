Ok, thanks! Maybe Jens should apear in the output of:

scripts/get_maintainer.pl fs/splice.c

I do because we're using that in our tdb library, but I hoped there would be
a way out...

Ok, I guess it's used for shared blocks in the filesystems,
in order to support things like cow support in order to allow
snapshots, correct?

Ok, thanks very much for the detailed feedback!

That sounds complicated and still racy.

Any comment about the idea of having a preadv2() flag that
asks for a dma copy with something like async_memcpy() instead
of the default that ends up in copy_user_enhanced_fast_string()?
If that would be possible, a similar flag would also be possible
for splice() in order to dma copy the pages into the pipe.
