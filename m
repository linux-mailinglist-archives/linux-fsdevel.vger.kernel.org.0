This feature was inspired by io_uring; it isn't exclusively of value
with io_uring. (And io_uring doesn't normally change the semantics of
syscalls.)

I definitely don't want to add a special kind of file descriptor that
doesn't work in normal syscalls taking file descriptors. A file
descriptor allocated via O_SPECIFIC_FD is an entirely normal file
descriptor, and works anywhere a file descriptor normally works.
