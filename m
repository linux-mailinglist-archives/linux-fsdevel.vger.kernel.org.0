I'm probably missing a ton of context (because at the end of the day I
don't care all that much about NOWAIT and still have never installed
liburing) but AFAICT the goal seems to be that for a given io request,
uring tries to execute it with trylocks in the originating process
context.  If that attempt fails, it'll punt the io to a workqueue and
rerun the request with blocking locks.  Right?

I've watched quite a bit of NOWAIT whackamole going on over the past few
years (i_rwsem, the ILOCK, the IO layer, memory allocations...).  IIRC
these filesystem ios all have to run in process context, right?  If so,
why don't we capture the NOWAIT state in a PF flag?  We already do that
for NOFS/NOIO memory allocations to make sure that /all/ reclaim
attempts cannot recurse into the fs/io stacks.

"I prefer EAGAIN errors to this process blocking" doesn't seem all that
much different.  But, what do I know...
