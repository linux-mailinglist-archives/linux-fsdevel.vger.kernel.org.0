Understood, I was just pointing out an oddity in the code.  I just
dropped the checks from my local tree, you'll see it in the next draft
of the patchset.

Audit has been around for quite some time now, and it's goal is to
provide a mechanism for logging "security relevant" information in
such a way that it meets the needs of various security certification
efforts.  Traditional Linux event logging, e.g. syslog and the like,
does not meet these requirements and changing them would likely affect
the usability for those who are not required to be compliant with
these security certifications.  The Linux audit subsystem allows Linux
to be used in places it couldn't be used otherwise (or rather makes it
a *lot* easier).

That said, audit is not for everyone, and we have build time and
runtime options to help make life easier.  Beyond simply disabling
audit at compile time a number of Linux distributions effectively
shortcut audit at runtime by adding a "never" rule to the audit
filter, for example:

 % auditctl -a task,never

Well, if audit alone erased all of the io_uring advantages we should
just rip io_uring out of the kernel and people can just disable audit
instead ;)

I believe there are people who would like to use io_uring and are also
required to use a kernel with audit, either due to the need to run a
distribution kernel or the need to capture security information in the
audit stream.  I'm hoping that we can find a solution for these users;
if we don't we are asking this group to choose either io_uring or
audit, and that is something I would like to avoid.
