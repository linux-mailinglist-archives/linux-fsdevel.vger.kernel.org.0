Sorry, I submitted v2 last night thinking the conversation on this
thread had died. After reading through your reply, I'll modify v2.

Yes the buffer rings are intended to be used with other io-uring
requests. The ideal scenario is that the user can then do the
equivalent of IORING_OP_READ/WRITE_FIXED operations on the
kernel-managed buffers and avoid the per-i/o page pinning overhead
costs.

I agree 100%. The api we add should be what's best for io-uring, not fuse.

For the majority of use cases, it seemed to me that having the buffers
separated from the buffer rings didn't yield perceptible benefits but
added complexity and more restrictions like having to statically know
up front how big the mem region needs to be across the lifetime of the
io-uring for anything the io-uring might use the mem region for. It
seems more generically useful as a concept to have the buffers owned
by the ring and tied to the lifetime of the ring. I like how with this
design everything is self-contained and multiple subsystems can use it
without having to reimplement functionality locally in the subsystem.
On the other hand, I see your point about how it might be something
users want in the future if they want complete control over which
parts of the mem region get used as the backing buffers to do stuff
like PMD optimizations.

I think this is a matter of opinion/preference and I think in general
for anything io-uring related, yours should take precedence.

With it going through a mem region, I don't think it should even go
through the "pbuf ring" interface then if it's not going to specify
the number of entries and buffer sizes upfront, if support is added
for io-uring normal requests (eg IORING_OP_READ/WRITE) to use the
backing pages from a memory region and if we're able to guarantee that
the registered memory region will never be able to be unregistered by
the user. I think if we repurpose the

union {
  __u64 addr; /* pointer to buffer or iovecs */
  __u64 splice_off_in;
};

fields in the struct io_uring_sqe to

union {
  __u64 addr; /* pointer to buffer or iovecs */
  __u64 splice_off_in;
  __u64 offset; /* offset into registered mem region */
};

and add some IOSQE_ flag to indicate it should find the pages from the
registered mem region, then that should work for normal requests.
Where on the kernel side, it looks up the associated pages stored in
the io_mapped_region's pages array for the offset passed in.

Right now there's only a uapi to register a memory region and none to
unregister one. Is it guaranteed that io-uring will never add
something in the future that will let userspace unregister the memory
region or at least unregister it while it's being used (eg if we add
future refcounting to it to track active uses of it)?

If so, then end-to-end, with it going through the mem region, it would
be something like:
* user creates a mem region for the io-uring
* user mmaps the mem region
* user passes in offset into region, length of each buffer, and number
of entries in the ring to the subsystem
* subsystem creates a locally managed bufring and adds buffers to that
ring from the mem region
* on the cqe side, it sends the buffer id of the registered mem region
through the same "IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER |  (buf_id <<
IORING_CQE_BUFFER_SHIFT)" mechanism

Does this design match what you had in mind / prefer?

I think the above works for Christoph's use case too (as his and my
use case are the same) but if not, please let me know.

Thanks,
Joanne
