Agree totally with this - we just want to block until allocation
succeeds, and if the -filesystem- deadlocks because allocation never
succeeds then that's a problem that needs to be solved in the
filesystem with a different memory allocation strategy...

OTOH, setting up a single __GFP_NOFAIL call site with the ability to
take the entire system down seems somewhat misguided.

Yup, we've been replacing open coded loops like in kmem_alloc() with
explicit __GFP_NOFAIL usage for a while now:

$ â–¶ git grep __GFP_NOFAIL fs/xfs |wc -l
33
$

ANd we've got another 100 or so call sites planned for conversion to
__GFP_NOFAIL. Hence the suggestion to remove the use of
reserves from __GFP_NOFAIL seems like a sensible plan because it has
never been necessary in the past for all the allocation sites we are
converting from open coded loops to __GFP_NOFAIL...

Cheers,

Dave.
