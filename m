Let's clarify: straightforward for you. The fact that HTree sat for 15
years with my lame, coded-in-a-day two level scheme suggests that this
would not be straightforward for everyone. In my defence, I plead that
at the time I regarded 10 millions files as essentially infinite. This
makes me think of "640K ought to be enough for anyone" naturally.

Some day somebody will have a use case for billion file directories.
Until that day comes, I am ok with regarding this capability as a mere
stunt, or proof of scalability. Scaling 2 orders of magnitude higher is
just one of the improvements Shardmap offers, and in some sense, the
least important of them.

Right. Shardmap linearizes pretty much everything, which seems to be
pretty much a necessity to achieve optimal performance with lowest
cache pressure, particularly with machines that are only marginally
capable of the load they are attempting.

The main problem with pure log structured updates is reading back the
log, which is randomly interleaved if written out in strict creation
order. This is the issue that LSM (as used by RocksDB and friends)
attempts to address:

   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree

Unfortunately, these solutions tend to be complex and top heavy on the
read side. In practice Shardmap won solidly in all of insert, lookup
and delete benchmarks when we benchmarked it. I am not sure why that
is, but it seems to be trying to do a lot of fancy stuff.

Shardmap uses a far simpler update technique: each new index entry is
simply appended to the end of the appropriate shard. The fewer the
shards, the more efficient that is. However, even when there are 1K
or up to 8K shards as we use for our 1 billion file benchmark, this
algorithm still works well in practice. The key trick is, include
enough updates in the commit so that each shard receives enough to
reduce the tail block write multiplication to a dull roar.

On my not very spectacular Ryzen 7 workstation backed by SSD, we
create 1 billion directory entries in a bit less than 12 minutes. Is
this fast enough? On spinning rust it takes two or three minutes
longer. Clearly Ext4 plus the block layer are doing a nice job of
minimizing seeks for this load.

OK, this confirms my impression of the sort of loads you feed to HTree.
In this range, I promise that you will see a solid speedup from Shardmap
for the directory ops alone, plus far better cache coherency with respect
to the inode table, and of course, a readdir that does not verge on
brilliant insanity.

Thanks for the comments Andreas, and I hope it is clear that I am also
offering Shardmap for Lustre. Not that you would even need to ask.

Daniel
