OK, let me try to venture down that "change the way ESTALE retries are
done completely" path. The problem here is I'm not familiar with the
code enough to be sure the conversion is 1-to-1 (i.e. that we can't get
ESTALE from somewhere unexpected), and that retries are open-coded in
quite a few places it seems. Anyway, I'll try and dig in and come back
with either an RFC patch or some questions. Thanks for the feedback, Al.
