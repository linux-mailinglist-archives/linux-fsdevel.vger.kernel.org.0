I'm actually not sure anymore if filemap_range_has_writeback() is 
actually needed. In fuse_flush() it calls write_inode_now(inode, 1), but 
I don't think that will flush queued fi->writectr (fi->writepages). Will 
report back in the afternoon.

Yeah, there is indeed another problem,
fuse_cache_write_iter() can fall back to page writes, but I had 
especially added a warning message in temporary patch - I didn't manage 
to trigger that path yet. Will add a fix for that.

Thanks,
Bernd
