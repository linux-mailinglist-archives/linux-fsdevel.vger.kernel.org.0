Just to make sure - head's at 4d0ba2f0250d?

One obvious comment (just about the problems you've dealt with in that branch;
I'll go over that tree and look for other sources of trouble, will post tonight):
all 3 callers of iov_iter_iovec() in there are accompanied by the identical
chunks that deal with ITER_UBUF case; it would make more sense to teach
iov_iter_iovec() to handle that.  loop_rw_iter() would turn into
	if (!iov_iter_is_bvec(iter)) {
		iovec = iov_iter_iovec(iter);
	} else {
		iovec.iov_base = u64_to_user_ptr(rw->addr);
		iovec.iov_len = rw->len;
	}
and process_madvise() and do_loop_readv_writev() patches simply go away.

Again, I'm _not_ saying there's no other problems left, just that these are
better dealt with that way.

Something like

static inline struct iovec iov_iter_iovec(const struct iov_iter *iter)
{
	if (WARN_ON(!iter->user_backed))
		return (struct iovec) {
			.iov_base = NULL,
			.iov_len = 0
		};
	else if (iov_iter_is_ubuf(iter))
		return (struct iovec) {
			.iov_base = iter->ubuf + iter->iov_offset,
			.iov_len = iter->count
		}; 
	else
		return (struct iovec) {
			.iov_base = iter->iov->iov_base + iter->iov_offset,
			.iov_len = min(iter->count,
				       iter->iov->iov_len - iter->iov_offset),
		};
}

and no need to duplicate that logics in all callers.  Or get rid of those
elses, seeing that each alternative is a plain return - matter of taste...
