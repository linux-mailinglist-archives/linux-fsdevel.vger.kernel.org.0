Joanne, let's drop the patch to migrate.c completely and let's rename
the flag to something like what David is suggesting and only handle in
the reclaim path.

Thanks David and yes let's handle the folios under writeback issue
separately.

I think the fragmentation due to movable pages becoming unmovable is
worse as that situation is unexpected and the kernel can waste a lot of
CPU to defrag the block containing those folios. For non-movable blocks,
the kernel will not even try to defrag. Now we can have a situation
where almost all memory is backed by non-movable blocks and higher order
allocations start failing even when there is enough free memory. For
such situations either system needs to be restarted (or workloads
restarted if they are cause of high non-movable memory) or the admin
needs to setup ZONE_MOVABLE where non-movable allocations don't go.

So, these temp pages are not an issue for fragmenting the movable blocks
but if there is no limit on temp pages, the whole system can become
non-movable (there is a case where movable blocks on non-ZONE_MOVABLE
can be converted into non-movable blocks under low memory). ZONE_MOVABLE
will avoid such scenario but tuning the right size of ZONE_MOVABLE is
not easy.

The main difference is the fallback of high order allocation which can
trigger compaction or background compaction through kcompactd. The
kernel will only try to defrag the movable blocks.
