void __ref kmemleak_not_leak(const void *ptr)
{
	pr_debug("%s(0x%p)\n", __func__, ptr);

	if (kmemleak_enabled && ptr && !IS_ERR(ptr))
		make_gray_object((unsigned long)ptr);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(kmemleak_not_leak);

In the code of kmemleak_not_leak(), it is verified that the pointer is 
valid, so kmemleak_not_leak (NULL) will not be a problem.
At the same time, there is no need to call kmemleak_not_leak() in the 
failed branch of register_sysctl_init().
