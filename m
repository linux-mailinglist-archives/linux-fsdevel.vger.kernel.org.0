Sorry, had to step out for an appointment.

Under the assumption that I'm not entirely off with this - and I really
could be ofc - then one possibility would be that we enable persistence
of files from f_op->poll() for SB_NOUSER filesystems.

That'll catch everything that's relying on anonymous inodes (drm and all
drivers) and init_pseudo() so everything that isn't actually unmountable
(pipefs, pidfs, sockfs, etc.).

So something like the _completely untested_ diff on top of your proposal
above:

Basically, my worry is that we end up with really annoying to debug
EBUSYs caused by epoll(). I'd really like to avoid that. But again, I
might be wrong and this isn't an issue.
