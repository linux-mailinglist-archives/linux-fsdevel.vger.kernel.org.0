(The flag could just go away when all filesystems not supporting it are
gone, and it could be made the other way around (e.g. explicit
NOT_SHARED to encourage migrations), so I don't really see the problem
with this but next point makes this moot anyway)

Right, sorry. I was thinking that since it's fs/op dependant it made
more sense to keep next to the iterate operation, but that'd be a
layering violation to look directly at the file_operation vector
directly from the uring code... So having it in the struct file is
better from that point of view.

Great, I wasn't aware of FMODE_NOWAIT; things are starting to fall in
place.
I'll send a v2 around Wed or Thurs (yay national holidays)

Yes, FMODE_NOWAIT will be set on directories as xfs_dir_open calls
xfs_file_open which sets it inconditionally... So I got to check other
filesystems don't do something similar as a bonus, but it looks like
none that set FMODE_NOWAIT on regular files share the file open path,
so at least that shouldn't be too bad.
Happy to also fold the xfs fix as a prerequisite patch of this series or
to let you do it, just tell me.


Thanks,
