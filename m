Hi Dave,

Here I've a question, in DIO read path, if we update the time but
later somehow got errors before actual reading, e.g. return -EAGAIN
from the xfs_ilock_iocb(), shouldn't we revert the time update since
we actually doesn't read the file? We can lazily update the time but
on the contrary a false update sounds weird to me.

Thanks,
Hao
