Indeed, we often have folks wanting dramatically different behavior from
getdents() in NFS, and every time we've tried to improve our heuristics
someone else shouts "regression"!

We can tune the NFS heuristic per-mount, but it often makes the wrong
choice..  As you say letting the application make the call would be ideal.
