Indeed, IIUC, the buggy code is as below, if any preallocation failed, we need to
set FI_NO_PREALLOC flag.

map_blocks:
	err = f2fs_map_blocks(inode, &map, 1, flag);
	if (map.m_len > 0 && err == -ENOSPC) {
		if (!direct_io)         <----
			set_inode_flag(inode, FI_NO_PREALLOC);
		err = 0;
	}

BTW, it will be better to include above issue details you explained into commit
message?

Thanks for the explain.

See commit f847c699cff3 ("f2fs: allow out-place-update for direct IO in LFS mode"),
f2fs_map_blocks() logic was changed to force allocating a new block address no matter
previous block address was existed if it is called from write path of DIO. So, in such
condition, if we preallocate new block address in f2fs_file_write_iter(), we will
suffer the problem which my trace indicates.

Got your concern.

For buffered IO, we use F2FS_GET_BLOCK_PRE_AIO, in this mode, we just preserve
filesystem block count and tag NEW_ADDR in dnode block, so, it's fine, double
new block address allocation won't happen during data page writeback.

For direct IO, we use F2FS_GET_BLOCK_PRE_DIO, in this mode, we will allocate
physical block address, after preallocation, if we fallback to buffered IO, we
may suffer double new block address allocation issue... IIUC.

Well, can we relocate preallocation into f2fs_direct_IO() after all cases which
may cause fallbacking DIO to buffered IO?

Thanks,
