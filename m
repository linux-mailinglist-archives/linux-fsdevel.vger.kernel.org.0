No, I don't think we should have weird kernel-only things in i_mode.
That's what i_flags is for.

The current way of relying on IS_REG() in do_open_execat() is broken
with current kernel semantics ever since commit 633fb6ac3980 ("exec:
move S_ISREG() check earlier"). That commit introduced a WARN_ON_ONCE()
around the S_ISREG() check which indicates that it wasn't clear to the
authors that this is very likely a reachable WARN_ON_ONCE() via e.g.:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int ret, sfd;
	sigset_t mask;
	struct signalfd_siginfo fdsi;

	sigemptyset(&mask);
	sigaddset(&mask, SIGINT);
	sigaddset(&mask, SIGQUIT);

	ret = sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, NULL);
	if (ret < 0)
		_exit(1);

	sfd = signalfd(-1, &mask, 0);
	if (sfd < 0)
		_exit(2);

	ret = fchown(sfd, 5555, 5555);
        if (ret < 0)
		_exit(3);

	ret = fchmod(sfd, 0777);
	if (ret < 0)
		_exit(3);

	/* trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE() */
	execveat(sfd, "", NULL, NULL, AT_EMPTY_PATH);
	_exit(4);
}

Because the mode and owner of the single anonymous inode in the
kernel can be changed by anonyone with suitable privileges. That of
course it itself a bug although not a really meaningful one because
anonymous inodes don't really figure into path lookup. They cannot be
reopened via /proc/<pid>/fd/<nr> and can't be used for lookup itself. So
they can only ever serve as direct references. But I'm going to fix
that. Similar to pidfs we should simply fail setattr [1]. Given that noone has
been hitting the execveat() WARN_ON_ONCE() it's safe to say that no one
ever bothered chowning/chmoding anonymous inodes. With that removed it's
not possible to exec anonymous inodes but we should harden this by
setting SB_I_NOEXEC as well (Secretmem is another very fun example
because it uses anonymous inodes but does set S_ISREG already. So
chmod() on such an inode and passing it to execveat() could be fun.)

Anyway, I'm finishing the patch and testing tomorrow and will send out
with all the things I mentioned (unless I find out I'm wrong).

[1]: That's been a constant sore spot for me. We currently simply
     fallback to simple_setattr() if the fs doesn't provide a dedicated
     ->setattr() function. Imho that's broken and we need to remove
     that. All fses that need it need to set ->setattr() and if it isn't
     set EOPNOTSUPP will be returned. So that would need some code audit
     which fses definitely don't need or expect it. Otherwise we risk
     setting attributes on things that don't want them changed. That's
     patch I had on my backlog for quite a while ever since the big
     xattr/acl rework.
