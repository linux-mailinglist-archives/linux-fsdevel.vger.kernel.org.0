accept4 has a flags argument with more flags available, so it'd be
entirely possible to cleanly extend it further without introducing a new
version. The same goes for other fd-producing syscalls that still have
flag space available.

This may or may not provide sufficient motivation on its own to
introduce a new syscall variant of a syscall that isn't currently
extensible.

"private" is not a desirable property here. See below. Even if the
userspace-specified fd mechanism were to become something only
accessible via io_uring (which I'd prefer to avoid), that's not a reason
to avoid generating real file descriptors that work anywhere a file
descriptor works.

I would prefer to not introduce that limitation in the first place, and
instead open normal file descriptors.

"close" is not a required component. It's entirely possible to use
io_uring to open a file descriptor, do various things with it, and then
leave it open for subsequent usage via either other io_uring chains or
standalone syscalls.

io_uring is not an all-or-nothing proposition. There's value in using
io_uring for some operations without converting an entire program (and
every library it might potentially use on a file descriptor) entirely to
io_uring. Userspace is modular, and file descriptors are a common
element used by many different bits of userspace.
