I may have become a little over-excited when I saw someone was thinking
about new code associated with these interfaces.  It's just that, to be
very kind, the existing interfaces have so much room for improvement.
I'm aware that changes in this area can be a non-trivial amount of
work, due to specific xattr keys being handled by different security
module hooks.

Well, there's removexattr(), but who's counting?
I believe people use the other *at() interfaces without ever looking
back at the old calls and that there is little point in io_uring reproducing
all of the old baggage.

Even though these functions desperately need updating, and as super nice
as it would be, I don't expect you to implement getxattrat() and setxattrat().
If I were to name a single thing that would most increase the usability of
these functions, it would be:
	Make the fXetxattr() functions (at least the io_uring versions)
	work with an O_PATH descriptor.
That one thing would at least provide most of the desired functionality at
the cost of an extra openat() call.
