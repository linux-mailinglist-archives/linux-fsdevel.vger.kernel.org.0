Thank you for taking the time to respond!

The point was that the familiar interface can be improved by changing its API.

Consider as if you were implementing a new syscall:
ssize_t getdents2(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t *offset, int flags);

This is close enough to pread() that no one would be slowed down by its
unfamiliarity.  It would work just like getdents64(), except that the fpos
at the end of the read would always be returned in offset.  At EOF, fpos 0
would be returned.  On the calling side, one would set a flag and set offset
to a value other than -1 to cause it to atomically change fpos before the read.

Just considering an io_uring (only) call, io_uring is already a new interface,
so the inconsistency point doesn't really seem to apply.

I believe the important part of the idea is the EOF processing, so I'll drop
the fpos discussion for now.  In this case you could use exactly the old
getdents64() API for io_uring with the minor addition of a returned flag bit.
My understanding, which I'll admit could be flawed, is that the directory
iterator should be testable for the EOF condition.  If correct, I'd think
that testing it and setting a bit in the cqe flags field is all you'd need.
So, as long as the internal call has access to the iterator, no new structures
are required.

In io_uring, if there is no EOF flag as suggested above, the best you
could probably due is to queue two requests, IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK-ed together,
every time you want some directory entries, and then look for a zero length
return.  That's extra logic, the extra wasted call, and already doubling the
required buffering.
