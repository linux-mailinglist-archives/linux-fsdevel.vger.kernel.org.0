Yes, thankfully there are not many. Other than the two mentioned
file_operations, the only other fops I find implementing both are
'null_ops' and 'zero_ops'; those are fine. And one other implements
just .write/.write_iter: trace_events_user.c, which is also fine.

I don't think we can change that now. io_uring has always used the
.{read,write}_iter callbacks if available ever since it introduced
non-vectored read/write (3a6820f2bb8a0). Altering the io_uring op's ABI
to align with the read/write syscalls seems risky.

But I don't think there are any real use cases affected by this series
anyway.

I feel like that's a worthy longer term goal, but I'll start looking
into it now.
