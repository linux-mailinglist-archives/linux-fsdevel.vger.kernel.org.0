And finally, just checking if we make it optional per opcode if we see
any real impact, and the answer is no. Using the below patch which
effectively bypasses audit calls unless the opcode has flagged the need
to do so, I cannot measure any difference in perf (as expected).

To turn this into something useful, my suggestion as a viable path
forward would be:

1) Use something like the below patch and flag request types that we
   want to do audit logging for.

2) As Pavel suggested, eliminate the need for having both and entry/exit
   hook, turning it into just one. That effectively cuts the number of
   checks and calls in half.
