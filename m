And for this validation caching to work properly, AFAIU you need to
hold the file->f_pos_lock (or have exclusive access to the "struct
file"), which happens in the normal getdents() path via fdget_pos().
This guarantees that the readdir handler has exclusive access to the
file's ->f_version, which has to stay in sync with the position.

By the way, this makes me wonder: If I open() an ext4 directory and
then concurrently modify the directory, call readdir() on it, and
issue IORING_OP_READV SQEs with ->off == -1, can that cause ext4 to
think that filesystem corruption has occurred?

io_uring has some dodgy code that seems to be reading and writing
file->f_pos without holding the file->f_pos_lock. And even if the file
doesn't have an f_op->read or f_op->read_iter handler, I think you
might be able to read ->f_pos of an ext4 directory and write the value
back later, unless I'm missing a check somewhere?

io_prep_rw() grabs file->f_pos; then later, io_read() calls
io_iter_do_read() (which will fail with -EINVAL), and then the error
path goes through kiocb_done(), which writes the position back to
req->file->f_pos. So I think the following race might work:

First, open an FD referencing a directory on an ext4 filesystem. Read
part of the directory's entries from the FD with getdents(). Then
modify the directory such that the FD's ->f_version is now stale. Then
do the race:

task A: start a IORING_OP_READV op on the FD and let it grab the stale
offset from file->f_pos
task B: run getdents() on the FD. after this, ->f_version is
up-to-date and ->f_pos points to the start of a dentry
task A: continue handling the IORING_OP_READV: io_iter_do_read()
fails, kiocb_done() overwrites the valid ->f_pos with the stale value
while leaving ->f_version up-to-date

Afterwards, the file might have an ->f_pos pointing in the middle of a
dentry while ->f_version indicates that it is valid (meaning it's
supposed to point to the start of a dentry). If you then do another
getdents() call on the FD, I think you might get garbage back and/or
make the kernel think that the filesystem is corrupted (depending on
what's stored at that offset)?
