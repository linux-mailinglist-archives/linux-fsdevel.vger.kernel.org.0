I think the semantic is well defined:
"This new syscall enables user space to ask the kernel: is this file
descriptor's content trusted to be used for this purpose?"
See the trusted_for_policy sysctl documentation: 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220104155024.48023-3-mic@digikod.net/

There is currently only one defined and implemented purpose: execution 
(or script interpretation). There is room for other flags because it is 
a good practice to do so, and other purposes were proposed.

I agree.

Well, naming is difficult, but I'm open to suggestion. :)

As explained in the description, the WHAT is the file descriptor 
content, the WHO TRUSTS is the system security policy (e.g. the mount 
point options) and the WHY is defined by the usage flag 
(TRUSTED_FOR_EXECUTION).
This translates to: is this file descriptor's content trusted to be used 
for this specified purpose/usage?

As answered in private, that was the approach I took for one of the 
early versions but a dedicated syscall was requested by Al Viro: 
https://lore.kernel.org/r/2ed377c4-3500-3ddc-7181-a5bc114ddf94@digikod.net
The main reason behind this request was that it doesn't have the exact 
same semantic as faccessat(2). The changes for this syscall are 
documented here: 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220104155024.48023-3-mic@digikod.net/
The whole history is linked in the cover letter: 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/2ed377c4-3500-3ddc-7181-a5bc114ddf94@digikod.net/

This initial proposal was using a new faccessat2(2) flag: 
AT_INTERPRETED, see 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200908075956.1069018-2-mic@digikod.net/
What do you think about that? I'm happy to get back to this version if 
everyone is OK with it.
