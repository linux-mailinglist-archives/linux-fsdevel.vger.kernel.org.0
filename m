More or less: yes, that is one possible use case.Â  But we could leave 
that one out since it is not the primary use case.

What happens more is that 99% of the resources are only allocated per 
process, but around 1% are shared with somebody else.

But see two comments below of a better description of the problem I'm 
facing.

Well it would be fine with me to leave out those 1% of resources shared 
with different memcgs.

What breaks my neck are those 99% which are allocated by a game and 
could potentially be shared but are most of the time not.

The problem is just that it can easily happen that one process is 
allocating the resource and a different one freeing it.

So just imaging the following example: Process opens X window, get 
reference to the handle of the buffer backing this window for drawing, 
tells X to close the window again and then a bit later closes the buffer 
handle.

In this example the X server would be charged allocating the buffer and 
the client (which is most likely in a different memcg group) is charged 
freeing it.

I could of course add something to struct page to track which memcg (or 
process) it was charged against, but extending struct page is most 
likely a no-go.

Alternative I could try to track the "owner" of a buffer (e.g. a shmem 
file), but then it can happen that one processes creates the object and 
another one is writing to it and actually allocating the memory.

That's what I had in mind as well. Problem with this approach is that 
file descriptors are currently not informed that they are shared between 
processes.

So to make this work we would need something like attach/detach to 
process in struct file_operations.

And as I noted, this happens rather often. For example a game which 
renders 120 frames per second needs to transfer 120 buffers per second 
between client and X.

So this is not something which could take a lot of time and the file 
descriptor tracking structures in the Linux kernel are not made for this 
either.

I think for now I will try something like this specific for DRM drivers. 
That doesn't solve the shmem file problem, but it at least gives me 
something at hand for the accelerated Linux desktop case.

Regards,
Christian.
