Actually, what Prof. Kim's research group was doing was taking the
latest file system formats (for ext4 and xfs) and fixing up the
checksum after fuzzing the metadata blocks.  The goal was to find
potential security vulnerabilities, not to see if file systems would
crash if fed invalid input.  At least for ext4, at least one of
Prof. Kim's fuzzing results was one that that I believe could have
been leveraged into a stack overflow attack.  I can't speak to his
results with respect to XFS, since I didn't look at them.
