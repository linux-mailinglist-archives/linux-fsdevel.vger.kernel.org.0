Sure. This was just to show how pattern can look like. Does not have to
be the final name. I agree that naming is hard, but in this case I think
the harder part would be to design API.

Btw, first 4 attributes were inherited from dos, so they are not
originally from windows. But that is not important and it is better to
have consistent naming.

Exactly, thank you for better explanation. If filesystem supports
"hidden" attribute then request from userspace call (setxattr
system.attr.hidden) would be translated to filesystem native "hidden"
attribute. Which for SMB2+ is SetInfo(), for NFS4 is op_setattr(hidden),
for FAT/exFAT/NTFS is updating hidden bit in attrbit field, for UDF is
updating hidden bit in FileCharacteristics. And for other filesystem
which supports "hidden" attribute natively, it would be stored as that
xattr system.attr.hidden as is.

Performance for sure needs to checked. I have already wrote it that it
could be a problem for userspace applications when they would need to
call lot of syscall to just list directory entries with all attributes.
So for getting attributes maybe some statx() interface could be useful.
In my opinion, applications would probably ask for attributes more times
than trying to set or change them. It is like stat() which is used more
times than utimes() (or other syscalls for changing stat stuff).

In any case, Linux SMB client is already fetching all those attributes
because basically SMB protocol always sends them. So SMB communication
between client and server should not be affected at all by any solution
which is going to be chosen.
