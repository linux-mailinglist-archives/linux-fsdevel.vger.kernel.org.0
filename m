It is a bad code.  If you look at that function, you'll see that the entire
mess around put_f is rather hard to follow and reason about.  That's a function
with no users, and I'm not sure we want to keep it long-term.

"don't drop the name on success", similar to what filename_parentat() does.

No need.

The last one is the easiest to answer - we want to keep the imported strings
around for audit.  It's not so much a proper refcounting as it is "we might
want freeing delayed" implemented as refcount.

As for do_mkdirat(), you probably want semantics similar to do_unlinkat(), i.e.
have it consume the argument passed to it.  The main complication comes
from ESTALE retries; want -ESTALE from ->mkdir() itself to trigger "redo
filename_parentat() with LOOKUP_REVAL, then try the rest one more time".
For which you need to keep filename around.  OK, so you want a variant of
filename_create() that would _not_ consume the filename on success (i.e.
act as filename_parentat() itself does).  Which is trivial to implement -
just rename filename_create() to __filename_create() and remove one of
two putname() in there, leaving just the one in failure exits.  Then
filename_create() itself becomes simply

static inline struct dentry *filename_create(int dfd, struct filename *name,
                                struct path *path, unsigned int lookup_flags)
{
	struct dentry *res = __filename_create(dfd, name, path, lookup_flags);
	if (!IS_ERR(res))
		putname(name);
	return res;
}

and in your do_mkdirat() replacement use
	dentry = __filename_create(dfd, filename, &path, lookup_flags);
instead of
        dentry = user_path_create(dfd, pathname, &path, lookup_flags);
and add
	putname(filename);
in the very end.  All it takes...
