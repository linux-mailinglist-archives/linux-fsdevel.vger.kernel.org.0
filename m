Let's keep semantics and implementation separate.  For the case
where we report the actual offset we need a size imitation and no
short writes.

Anything with those semantics can be implemented using Zone Append
trivially in zonefs, and we don't even need the exclusive lock in that
case.  But even without that flag anything that has an exclusive lock can
at least in theory be implemented using Zone Append, it just need
support for submitting another request from the I/O completion handler
of the first.  I just don't think it is worth it - with the exclusive
lock we do have access to the zone serialied so a normal write works
just fine.  Both for the sync and async case.

For zonefs we can, yes.  But in many ways that is a lot more cumbersome
that having an API that works on the fd you want to write on.

File systems might have all kinds of limits of their own (e.g. extent
sizes).  And a good API that just works everywhere and is properly
documented is much better than heaps of cargo culted crap all over
applications.
