Systemd doesn't like 0 length files appearing in efivarfs, even if only
momentarily, so I think this needs updating to prevent even momentary
instances of zero length files:

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/34304

These occur for two reasons

   1. The system has hibernated and resumed and the dcache entries are
      now out of sync with the original variables
   2. between the create and a successful write of a variable being
      created in efivarfs

1. can only really be fixed by adding a hibernation hook to the
filesystem code, which would be a separate patch set (which I'll work
on after we get this upstream); but 2. can be fixed by ensuring that
all variables returned from .create aren't visible in the directory
listing until a successful write.

Since we need the file to be visible to lookups but not the directory,
the only two ways of doing this are either to mark the directory in a
way that libfs.c:dcache_readdir() won't see it ... I think this would
have to be marking it as a cursor (we'd remove the cursor mark on
successful write); or to implement our own .iterate_shared function and
hijack the actor to skip newly created files (this is similar to what
overlayfs does to merge directories) which would be identified as
having zero size.

Do the fs people have a preference? The cursor mark is simpler to
implement but depends on internal libfs.c magic. The actor hijack is at
least something that already exists, so would be less prone to breaking
due to internal changes.

Regards,

James
