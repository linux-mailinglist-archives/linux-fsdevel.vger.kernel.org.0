Okay.

The ",shutdown" string is only displayed by show_options when specific
flags are set; it's not actually parsed by remount. Unless the sysadmin
sees it in the mount command output and then mounts with this option.

Since XFS is typically already shut down when it returns EIO, this prompt
may not be important for xfs. However, it's not as straightforward to
distinguish between EIO and shutdown for file systems that support a
continue mode or allow some operations even after shutdown.

Okay.

The remount-ro mode generally only becomes read-only when metadata errors
occurï¼Œtoo. I think if users have no need to read after an error, there is
basically no difference between read-only and shutdown. In fact,
errors=remount-ro does more; it allows users to back up some potentially
lost data after an error and then exit gracefully. However, reading
corrupted metadata does have some risks, for which we have done a lot of
work.
