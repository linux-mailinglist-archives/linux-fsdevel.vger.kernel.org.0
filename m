It won't clash with splice(2), just make that flag illegal if done
through splice(2) directly. Honestly I think that's (by FAR) the best
way to do it, having a private io_uring flag that acts as a splice flag
is really confusing and prone to breakage. Not that it's a huge issue
with splice as the flags have been stable for years, so don't really see
a high risk of collision. But we should still do it right, which means
adding SPLICE_F_OUT_FIXED or whatever you want to call it. Do that as a
prep patch, make do_splice() into __do_splice(), and have io_uring call
__do_splice(). Currently splice(2) is permissive in terms of flags, so
maybe just mask it in do_splice() to be on the safe side. Then we know
only internal users will set SPLICE_F_OUT_FIXED, and we'll never run
into the risk of having a collision as it's part of the flag space
anyway.

The sqe->flags space is very tight, so adding a splice specific opcode
there would be bad.
