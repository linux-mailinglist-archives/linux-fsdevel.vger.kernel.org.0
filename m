Hi Joanne,

yeah, the solution in the link above is definitely not ideal and I think
a timout based solution would be better. But I think your patch wouldn't
work either right now, unless server side sets a request timeout.
Btw, I would rename the variable 'daemon_timeout' to somethink like
req_timeout.

There is another discussion here, where timeouts are a possible although
ugly solution to avoid page copies

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kernel/233a9fdf-13ea-488b-a593-5566fc9f5d92@fastmail.fm/T/


That is the bg writeback code path.

If daemon side configures timeouts. And interrupted requests might want
to have a different timeout. I will check when I'm back if we can update
your patch a bit for that.

Your patch hooks in quite nicely and basically without overhead into fg
(sync) requests. Timing out bg requests will have a bit overhead (unless
I miss something), so maybe we need two solutions here. And if we want
to go that route at all, to avoid these extra fuse page copies.

Thank you! For now I'm not connecting power, 3h of battery left :)
