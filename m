No, sounds good.

Sounds good.

Nothing per se. Ok, you asked so it's your fault:
When writing programs I like to never use relative paths with AT_FDCWD
because. Because making assumptions about the current working directory
of the calling process is just too easy to get wrong; especially when
pivot_root() or chroot() are in play.
My absolut preference (joke intended) is to open a well-known starting
point with an absolute path to get a dirfd and then scope all future
operations beneath that dirfd. This already works with old-style
openat() and _very_ cautious programming but openat2() and its
resolve-flag space have made this **chef's kiss**.
If I can't operate based on a well-known dirfd I use absolute paths with
a -EBADF dirfd passed to *at() functions.
