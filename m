From what I remember the pointer into the iov[] gets incremented
as it is processed - which makes 'backing up' hard.
The caller also has to remember the original pointer because
it might point to kmalloced memory.

So if the 'iter' always contained a pointer to the base of the iov[]
then various bits of code could be simplified.

Another useful change would be to embed the short iov_cache[8]
inside 'iter'.
Almost all the callers allocate both together (usually on stack)
so the stack use won't change.
I have local patches for most of this (somewhere) but the io_uring
changes start being non-trivial.
