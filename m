I'm sorry, what is suspect about my approach? Your patch in [1] lowered
the capability checks to ns_capable(current_user_ns(), CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH).
That's very much wrong because it means root in an unprivileged
container could linkat() any file descriptor including any opened by
real root. The permission needs to be tied to the opener of the file.
Otherwise that's guaranteed to break security assumptions. Whereas my
patch avoids that.
