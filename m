Apologies for this draft rumbling...

As you mentioned, io_uring_task_cancel() cancels and waits for all
requests submitted by current task, used in exec() and SQPOLL because
of potential races.

io_uring_task_cancel() cancels only selected ones, e.g. in 5.15
will be only requests operating on io_uring, and used during normal
exit.

Agree that the names may be not too descriptive.
