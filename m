Yes.

Assuming that is this mail:
https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/CAG48ez1O9VxSuWuLXBjke23YxUA8EhMP+6RCHo5PNQBf3B0pDQ@mail.gmail.com/

So, ok, I didn't realize fdget_pos() actually acted as a lock on the
file's f_pos_lock (apparently only if FMODE_ATMOIC_POS is set? but it
looks set on most if not all directories through finish_open(), that
looks called consistently enough)

What was confusing is that default_llseek updates f_pos under the
inode_lock (write), and getdents also takes that lock (for read only in
shared implem), so I assumed getdents also was just protected by this
read lock, but I guess that was a bad assumption (as I kept pointing
out, a shared read lock isn't good enough, we definitely agree there)


In practice, in the non-registered file case io_uring is also calling
fdget, so the lock is held exactly the same as the syscall and I wasn't
so far off -- but we need to figure something for the registered file
case.
openat variants don't allow working with the registered variant at all
on the parent fd, so as far as I'm concerned I'd be happy setting the
same limitation for getdents: just say it acts on fd and not files, and
call it a day...
It'd also be possible to check if REQ_F_FIXED_FILE flag was set and
manually take the lock somehow but we don't have any primitive that
takes f_pos_lock from a file (the only place that takes it is fdget
which requires a fd), so I'd rather not add such a new exception.
I assume the other patch you mentioned about adding that lock was this
one:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220222105504.3331010-1-dylany@fb.com/T/#m3609dc8057d0bc8e41ceab643e4d630f7b91bde6
and it just atkes the lock, but __fdget_pos also checks for
FMODE_ATOMIC_OPS and file_count and I'm not sure I understand how it
sets (f.flags & FDPUT_POS_UNLOCK) (for fdput_pos) so I'd rather not add
such a code path at this point..


So, ok, what do you think about just forbidding registered files?
I can't see where that wouldn't suffice but I might be missing something
else.

(so seek is fine, but I agree two concurrent getdents on registered
files won't have the required lock)
