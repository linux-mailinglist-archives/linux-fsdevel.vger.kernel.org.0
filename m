Unless I've missed something, either current->mm or sqo_mm will be
used depending on which thread ends up doing the IO.  (And there might
be similar issues with threads.)  Having the user memory references
end up somewhere that is an implementation detail seems suboptimal.

Yikes, I missed that.

Andres, how final is your Postgres branch?  I'm wondering if we could
get away with requiring a special flag when creating an io_uring to
indicate that you intend to submit IO from outside the creating mm.

Even if we can't make this change, we could plausibly get away with
tying seccomp-style filtering to sqo_mm.  IOW we'd look up a
hypothetical sqo_mm->io_uring_filters to filter SQEs even when
submitted from a different mm.
