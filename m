*IF* those files are on purely internal filesystem, that's probably
OK; do that with something on something mountable (char device,
sysfs file, etc.) and you have a problem with filesystem staying
busy.

I'm really unfamiliar with the subsystem; it might be OK with all
objects that use that for ->poll(), but that's definitely not a good
thing to see in ->poll() instance in general.  And code gets copied,
so there really should be a big fat comment about the reasons why
it's OK in this particular case.

Said that, it seems that a better approach might be to have
their ->release() cancel callbacks and drop fence references.
Note that they *do* have refcounts - on fences.  The file
(well, dmabuf, really) is pinned only to protect against the
situation when pending callback is still around.  And Kees'
observation about multiple fences is also interesting - we don't
get extra fput(), but only because we get events only from one
fence, which does look fishy...
