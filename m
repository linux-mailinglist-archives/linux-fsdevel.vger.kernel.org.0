Allowing DIO segments to be aligned (in memory address and/or length) to
less than crypto_data_unit_size on encrypted files has been attempted
and discussed before.  Read the cover letter of
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20220128233940.79464-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/

We eventually decided to proceed with DIO support without it, since it
would have added a lot of complexity.  It would have made the bio
splitting code in the block layer split bios at boundaries where the
length isn't aligned to crypto_data_unit_size, it would have caused a
lot of trouble for blk-crypto-fallback, and it even would have been
incompatible with some of the hardware drivers (e.g. ufs-exynos.c).

It also didn't seem to be all that useful, and it would have introduced
edge cases that don't get tested much.  All reachable to unprivileged
userspace code too, of course.

I can't say that the idea seems all that great to me.

We can always reconsider and still add support for this.  But it's not
clear to me what's changed.
