I canâ€™t agree with you that the user namespace is one of others. It is
the namespace for namespaces. It sets security boundaries in the system
and we need to know them to understand the whole system.

If user namespaces are not used in the system or on a container, you
will see all namespaces in one directory. But if the system has a more
complicated structure, you will be able to build a full picture of it.

You said that one of the users of this feature is CRIU (the tool to
checkpoint/restore containers)  and you said that it would be good if
CRIU will be able to collect all container namespaces before dumping
processes, sockets, files etc. But how will we be able to do this if we
will list all namespaces in one directory?

Here are my thoughts why we need to the suggested structure is better
than just a list of namespaces:

* Users will be able to understand securies bondaries in the system.
  Each namespace in the system is owned by one of user namespace and we
  need to know these relationshipts to understand the whole system.

* This is simplify collecting namespaces which belong to one container.

For example, CRIU collects all namespaces before dumping file
descriptors. Then it collects all sockets with socket-diag in network
namespaces and collects mount points via /proc/pid/mountinfo in mount
namesapces. Then these information is used to dump socket file
descriptors and opened files.

* We are going to assign names to namespaces. But this means that we
need to guarantee that all names in one directory are unique. The
initial proposal was to enumerate all namespaces in one proc directory,
that means names of all namespaces have to be unique. This can be
problematic in some cases. For example, we may want to dump a container
and then restore it more than once on the same host. How are we going to
avoid namespace name conficts in such cases?

If we will have per-user-namespace directories, we will need to
guarantee that names are unique only inside one user namespace.

* With the suggested structure, for each user namepsace, we will show
  only its subtree of namespaces. This looks more natural than
  filltering content of one directory.
