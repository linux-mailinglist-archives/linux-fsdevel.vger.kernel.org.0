Heh, that's as glib as saying people should test their C code for
overcommit errors.  If everyone did that there'd be no need for
languages like rust.

Reliability has many definitions.  The kernel tries to leave policy
like this to the user, which is why the overcommit type is exposed to
userspace.  Arguing about whose workload is more important isn't really
going to be helpful.

So? the point would be we can eliminate some potentially buggy error
legs on small allocations.  Since we have to add MAY_FAIL and error
handling (which should already exist) to the larger ones.  It would
have no impact at all on scaling.  The question of where the limit
should be in the general case should probably be compile time
configurable.  We can probably even get the compiler to eliminate the
if (err) leg with some judicious return value priming, meaning we
achieve some meaningful bug density reduction for no or very few code
changes.
