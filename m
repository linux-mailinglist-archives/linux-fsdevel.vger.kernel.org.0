Hello Linus,

Thanks for your quick reply.

I don't think this is correct. The epoll(7) manual page
sill carries the text written long ago by Davide Libenzi,
the creator of epoll:

    Since  even with edge-triggered epoll, multiple events can be gen‚Äê
    erated upon receipt of multiple chunks of data, the caller has the
    option  to specify the EPOLLONESHOT flag, to tell epoll to disable
    the associated file descriptor after the receipt of an event  with
    epoll_wait(2).

My reading of that text is that in the scenario that I describe a
readiness notification should be generated at step 3 (and indeed
should be generated whenever additional data bleeds into the channel).
Indeed, the very rationale for the existence of the EPOLLONESHOT flag
is to *prevent* notifications in such circumstances. And, as I noted,
sockets and terminals do (still) behave in the way that I expect in
this scenario.

So, I don't think this is a buggy test. It (still) appears to me
that this is a breakage of intended and documented behavior.
(Whether it breaks some actual application, I do not know. But
I have also seen that sometimes reports of such breakages take
a very time to come in.)

Thanks,

Michael
