Things go into the tree for testing when the VFS side is ready for
testing. We're at v5 and the patchset has gone through four iterations
over multiple months. It will go into linux-next and fs-next now for as
much expsure as possible.

I'm not sure what the confusion between merging things into a tree and
sending things upstream is. I have explained this to you before. The
application message is also pretty clear about that.
