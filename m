Sorry for being late to work on this.

While checking it, I noticed it's generic to return -EFAULT in kernel.
E.g in kernfs_file_read_iter(). Even though 'man 3 read' does give the
same words as you noted.

However, the manpage says the less then nbyte case happened just in case
the number of bytes left in the file is less than nbyte. The returning
-EFAULT in read_vmcore() seems to be a little different and not
satisfying the condition, because the left bytes should be greater than
the nbyte when reading out the elf note, or the middle of the vmcore. So
we should leave it as is?

Abstract from man page of read:
====
Upon successful completion, where nbyte is greater than 0, read() shall mark for update the last data access timestamp of the
file, and shall return the number of bytes read.  This number shall never be greater than nbyte.  The value returned  may  be
less  than  nbyte if the number of bytes left in the file is less than nbyte, if the read() request was interrupted by a sig‚Äê
nal, or if the file is a pipe or FIFO or special file and has fewer than nbyte bytes immediately available for  reading.  For
example, a read() from a file associated with a terminal may return one typed line of data.
