I seem to recall making a few comments the last time a getdents64
for io_uring was proposed; in particular I wanted to bring up one
here.  This applies only to altering the internal interface, which
io_uring would use, although wiring up a new syscall would be a nice
addition.

The current interface has 2 issues:

1)
getdents64 requires at least two calls to read a directory.
One or more to get the dents and a final call to see the EOF.
With small directories, this means literally 50% of the calls
are wasted.

2)
The fpos cannot be changed atomically with a read, so it is not
possible to to safely perform concurrent reads on the same fd.

But, the kernel knows (most, if not all of the time) that it is at
EOF at the time it returns the last buffer.  So, it would be very
useful to get an EOF indicator back with the final buffer.  This
could just a flag, or for instance make an fpos parameter which is
both input and output, returning the (post read) fpos or zero at
EOF.

Futhermore, for input, one could supply:
	0:	Start from directory beginning
	-1:	Read from current position
	other:	(output from previous call) Read from here
