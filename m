Not sure what you're even disagreeing with, as I *do* expect new filesystems to
be held to a high standard, and to be written with the assumption that the
on-disk data may be corrupted or malicious.  We just can't expect the bar to be
so high (e.g. no bugs) that it's never been attained by *any* filesystem even
after years/decades of active development.  If the developers were careful, the
code generally looks robust, and they are willing to address such bugs as they
are found, realistically that's as good as we can expect to get...
