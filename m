One problem with making up i_generation (like FAT does it) is that when
inode gets reclaimed and then refetched from the disk FILEID_INO64_GEN will
change because it's going to have different i_generation. For NFS this is
annoying but I suppose it mostly does not happen since client's accesses
tend to keep the inode in memory. For fanotify it could be more likely to
happen if watching say the whole filesystem and I suppose the watching
application will get confused by this. So I'm not convinced faking
i_generation is a good thing to do. But still I want to brainstorm a bit
about it :)

These default calls seem a bit too subtle to me. I'd rather add explicit
handlers to filesystems that really want FILEID_INO32_GEN encoding and then
have a fallback function for filesystems not having s_export_op at all.

But otherwise the proposal to make name_to_handle_at() work even for
filesystems not exportable through NFS makes sense to me. But I guess we
need some buy-in from VFS maintainers for this.

Well, but with pseudo filesystems (similarly as with FUSE) the notification
was always unreliable. As in: some cases worked but others did not. I'm not
sure that is something we should try to replicate :)

So still I'd be interested to know which filesystems we are exactly
interested to support and whether we are not better off to explicitely add
fsid support to them like we did for tmpfs.

Yes, userspace can workaround this but I was more thinking about avoiding
adding these workarounds into fanotify in kernel *and* to userspace.

I see, yes, these reasons make sense.

Yeah. Actually I like the idea of a seamless change to start reporting fsid
and also to start reporting "fake" handles. In the past we've already
enabled tmpfs like this...
