I don't quite follow your logic for that last part; If there are 2 separate
bits; KPF_THP and KPF_MTHP, and KPF_THP is only set for PMD-sized THP, that
would be a safe/compatible approach, right? Where as your suggestion requires
changes to existing tools to work.

Thinking about this a bit more, I wonder if PKF_MTHP is the right name for a new
flag; We don't currently expose the term "mTHP" to user space. I can't think of
a better name though.

I'd still like to understand what is actually broken that this change is fixing.
Is the concern that a user could see KPF_THP and advance forward by
"/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hpage_pmd_size / getpagesize()" entries?
