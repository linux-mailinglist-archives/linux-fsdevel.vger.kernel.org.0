Well, the reason for doing it is that for uid/gid changes that's the
way everything else does it, so principle of least surprise.

However, there are two other cases where this doesn't work:

   1. inode uid/gid changes, which are compared against the real uid/gidÂ 
   2. execution, where we need to bring the filesystem uid/gid to the
      exterior representation of the interior values for unprivileged
      execution to work.
   3. the capable_wrt_inode checks where we're usually checking if the
      inode uid/gid has an interior mapping, but since for shiftfs we're
      assuming inode uid/gid are interior we need to see if anything maps
      to them.
   4. the in_group_p checks to see whether we're in a group that's
      capable.

1. could be fixed by shifting uid/gid ... I just didn't think this was
a good idea.  2,3. can't be fixed because the direction of the check
needs to be reversed and 4 has to be done separately because group_info
 is a pointer to something that lives outside the credential.  Taking
the pointer, creating a new one and shifting every group is possible, I
just also wasn't sure if it was a wise thing to do.

So it is true, if current_fsuid/fsgid did the mapping, it would be a
fifth case above, but we'd have to be sure no-one ever used the bare
current_cred()->fsuid.  Auditing filesystems, it looks like there's
only one current case of this in namei.c:may_follow_link(), so I think
it could work ... but it's still a danger for other places, like
security module checks and things.

xattr handling wasn't really missed, I left it out because it was the
controversial case last time.  Should the interior root be able to set
xattrs?  I think the argument was tending towards the yes except
security. prefix ones last time so perhaps it is safe to reintroduce.

Unfortunately, read and write aren't the only operations where we need
a shift, there's also lookup (which doesn't require read or write). 
Now we could also go with mnt_want_lookup/mnt_drop_lookup or simply
keep the existing shift coding on the lookup path.

Of the two ideas, I think using a generic gate point, if we can find
it, is a definite winner because it programmatically identifies the
shift points.  I'm less enthused about moving the shift into
current_fsuid/fsgid because of the potential for stuff to go wrong and
because it's counter to how everything else is currently done, but I'll
let the filesystem experts weigh in on this one.  The good news is that
the two ideas aren't dependent on each other so either can be
implemented without the other.
