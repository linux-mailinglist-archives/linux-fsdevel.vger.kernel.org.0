Yes, that's quite possible.  IIRC you can get 2MB folios for 8k
fsblocks.

I misspoke -- should have said "there will be no more than one (large)
folio for a single fsblock".  Sorry about the confusion; my old brain is
still stuck in 2015 sometimes.

Nope, your understanding is correct. :)

Oh!  Yes, that's right, they /are/ equivalent!
