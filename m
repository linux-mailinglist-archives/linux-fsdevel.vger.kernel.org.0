I note that this patch doesn't allow writes to swap files.  So Amir's
generic/554 test will still fail for those file systems that don't use
copy_file_range.

I'm indifferent as to whether you add a new patch, or include that
change in this patch, but perhaps we should fix this while we're
making changes in these code paths?
