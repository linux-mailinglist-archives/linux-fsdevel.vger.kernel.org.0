Hey Linus,

/* Summary */
This contains miscellaneous features, cleanups, and fixes for vfs and
individual fs.

Features
========
* Use mode 0600 for file created by cachefilesd so it can be run by
  unprivileged users. This aligns them with directories which are
  already created with mode 0700 by cachefilesd.
* Reorder a few members in struct file to prevent some false sharing
  scenarios.
* Indicate that an eventfd is used a semaphore in the eventfd's fdinfo
  procfs file.
* Add a missing uapi header for eventfd exposing relevant uapi defines.
* Let the VFS protect transitions of a superblock from read-only to
  read-write in addition to the protection it already provides for
  transitions from read-write to read-only. Protecting read-only to
  read-write transitions allows filesystems such as ext4 to perform
  internal writes, keeping writers away until the transition is
  completed.

Cleanups
========
* Arnd removed the architecture specific arch_report_meminfo()
  prototypes and added a generic one into procfs.h.
  Note, we got a report about a warning in amdpgpu codepaths that
  suggested this was bisectable to this change but we concluded it was a
  false positive.
* Remove unused parameters from split_fs_names().
* Rename put_and_unmap_page() to unmap_and_put_page() to let the name
  reflect the order of the cleanup operation that has to unmap before
  the actual put.
* Unexport buffer_check_dirty_writeback() as it is not used outside of
  block device aops.
* Stop allocating aio rings from highmem.
* Protecting read-{only,write} transitions in the VFS used open-coded
  barriers in various places. Replace them with proper little helpers
  and document both the helpers and all barrier interactions involved
  when transitioning between read-{only,write} states.
* Use flexible array members in old readdir codepaths.

Fixes
=====
* Use the correct type __poll_t for epoll and eventfd.
* Replace all deprecated strlcpy() invocations, whose return value isn't
  checked with an equivalent strscpy() call.
* Fix some kernel-doc warnings in fs/open.c
* Reduce the stack usage in jffs2's xattr codepaths finally getting
  rid of this:
  fs/jffs2/xattr.c:887:1: error: the frame size of 1088 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
  royally annoying compilation warning.
* Use __FMODE_NONOTIFY instead of FMODE_NONOTIFY where an int and not
  fmode_t is required to avoid fmode_t to integer degradation warnings.
* Create coredumps with O_WRONLY instead of O_RDWR. There's a long
  explanation in that commit how O_RDWR is actually a bug which we found
  out with the help of Linus and git archeology.
* Fix "no previous prototype" warnings in the pipe codepaths.
* Add overflow calculations for remap_verify_area() as a signed addition
  overflow could be triggered in xfstests.
* Fix a null pointer dereference in sysv.
* Use an unsigned variable for length calculations in jfs avoiding
  compilation warnings with gcc 13.
* Fix a dangling pipe pointer in the watch queue codepath.
* The legacy mount option parser provided as a fallback by the VFS for
  filesystems not yet converted to the new mount api did prefix the
  generated mount option string with a leading ',' causing issues for
  some filesystems.
* Fix a repeated word in a comment in fs.h.
* autofs: Update the ctime when mtime is updated as mandated by POSIX.

/* Testing */
clang: Ubuntu clang version 15.0.7
gcc: (Ubuntu 12.2.0-3ubuntu1) 12.2.0

All patches are based on v6.4-rc2 and have been sitting in linux-next.
No build failures or warnings were observed. All old and new tests in
fstests, selftests, and LTP pass without regressions.

/* Conflicts */
There are two merge conflicts:

(1) This will cause a minor merge conflict with my v6.5/vfs.file pull
    request which renames an internal helper that's used in cachefiles.
    I would suggest to merge v6.5/vfs.misc first.
(2) linux-next: manual merge of the tip tree with the vfs-brauner tree
    https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230622131108.19059f3c@canb.auug.org.au

At the time of creating this PR no merge conflicts showed up doing a
test-merge with current mainline.
