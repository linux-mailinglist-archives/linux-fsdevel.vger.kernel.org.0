Yes you're right.  With is_writ check it looks all fine.

Why this has anything to worry?  Isn't that memcpy only applies to a
page_region struct?

I didn't even notice you used to use write lock.  Yes I think read lock is
suffice here.

I think this is fine as long as the semantics is correct, which I believe
is the case.  The spinlock can be optimized, but it can be done on top if
needs more involved changes.

Good to have tests covering that.  I'd say you can add the test into
selftests along with the series when you repost if it's convenient.  It can
be part of an existing test or it can be a new one under mm/.
