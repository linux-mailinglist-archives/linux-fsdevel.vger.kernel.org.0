I think the intent of this extra check is to ensure the folio will be fully
contained within the exec vma? Assuming end is the VA of the end of the vma and
address is the VA of the fault, I don't think the maths are quite right? What's
the "*2" for? And you probably mean PAGE_SIZE<<order ? But this also doesn't
account for alignment; the folio will be aligned down to a natural boundary in
the file.

But more fundamentally, I thought I suggested reducing the VMA bounds to exclude
padding pages the other day at LSF/MM and you said you didn't want to do that
because you didn't want to end up with something else mapped in the gap? So
doesn't that mean the padding pages are part of the VMA and this check won't help?

What are those percentages? They don't add up to more than 100...

The numbers I included with the patch are caclulated based on actual mappings so
if we end up with a partially mapped 64K folio (because it runs off the end of
the VMA) it wouldn't have been counted as a 64K contiguous mapping. So I don't
think this type of change would change my numbers at all.

Matthew,

Did you have any thoughts on these options?
