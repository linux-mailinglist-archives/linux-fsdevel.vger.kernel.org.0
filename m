How are you my dear,

My name is Mrs Caroline Kowan,I wish to donate towards education and
the less privileged through your help.I am writing concerning my plans
to donate in memory of my deceased husband,

Rt. Rev Luke Kowan, I wish to donate toward education and the less
privileged and to ask for your assistance. As you may know, I am
suffering from colon cancer,according to my doctor, I have few weeks
to live please i need prayer's.

Throughout his years; my husband stressed the importance of education
and the less privileged I feel that this is what he would have wanted
me to do with the money that he left for charity.

These services bring so much joy to the kids. Together we are
transforming lives and building brighter futures-but without you, it
just wouldn't be possible. Thank you so much for your support.

Sincerely Mrs Caroline Kowan
