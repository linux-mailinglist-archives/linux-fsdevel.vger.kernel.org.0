Just the improved docs, or flipping the default of core.fsyncObjectFiles
to "true"?

I've been meaning to re-roll this. I won't have time anytime soon to fix
git's fsync() use, i.e. ensure that we run up & down modified
directories and fsync()/fdatasync() file/dir fd's as appropriate but I
think documenting it and changing the core.fsyncObjectFiles default
makes sense and is at least a step in the right direction.

I do think it makes more sense for a v2 to split most of this out into
some section that generally discusses data integrity in the .git
directory. I.e. that says that currently where we use fsync() (such as
pack/commit-graph writes) we don't fsync() the corresponding
director{y,ies), and ref updates don't fsync() at all.

Where to put that though? gitrepository-layout(5)? Or a new page like
gitrepository-integrity(5) (other suggestions welcome..).

Looking at the code again it seems easier than I thought to make this
right if we ignore .git/refs (which reftable can fix for us). Just:

1. Change fsync_or_die() and its callsites to also pass/sync the
   containing directory, which is always created already
   (e.g. .git/objects/pack/)...).

2. ..Or in the case where it's not created already such as
   .git/objects/??/ (or .git/objects/pack/) itself) it's not N-deep like
   the refs hierarchy, so "did we create it" state is pretty simple, or
   we can just always do it unconditionally.

3. Without reftable the .git/refs/ case shouldn't be too hard if we're
   OK with redundantly fsyncing all the way down, i.e. to make it
   simpler by not tracking the state of exactly what was changed.

4. Now that I'm writing this there's also .git/{config,rr-cache} and any
   number of other things we need to change for 100% coverage, but the
   above 1-3 should be good enough for repo integrity where repo =3D refs
   & objects.
