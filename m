Ah, I see what you're complaining about now. But I'm still not happy
that we didn't manage to resolve this confusion earlier.

I was not clear in what way you did rely on that branch and that you
relied on me not folding in the mutex fix especially because you didn't
reply when I said I would fold it and you said that putting fixes on top
wouldn't work upthread.

If I'm aware that a branch is shared and relied upon then I won't change it.
I would've immediately rolled it back would I have know that this causes
issues for you but to me everything looked fine when I didn't hear back.
