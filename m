You've read the file and you failed but you did access the file. We have
the same logic kinda for readdir in the sense that we call
file_accessed() no matter if ->iterate_shared() or ->iterate() succeeded
or not.

Plus, you should just be able to reorder the read checks to mirror the
write checks. Afaict, the order of the write checks are:

xfs_file_write_checks()
-> xfs_ilock_iocb()
-> kiocb_modified()

so we can just do:

+ xfs_file_read_checks()
  +-> xfs_ilock_iocb()
      +-> file_accessed()/kiocb_accessed()

for the read checks. Then we managed to acquire the necessary lock.
