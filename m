First, we have no way to know what requests are in flight, without it
CR doesn't make much sense. The most compelling way for me is to add
a feature to fail all in-flights as it does when is closed. But maybe,
you already did solve it somehow?

There is probably a way to restore registered buffers and files, though
it may be tough considering that files may not have corresponding fds in
the userspace, buffers may be unmapped, buffers may come from
shmem/etc. and other corner cases.

There are also not covered here pieces of state, SELECT_BUFFER
buffers, personalities (aka creds), registered eventfd, io-wq
configuration, etc. I'm assuming you'll be checking them and
failing CR if any of them is there.

And the last point, there will be some stuff CR of which is
likely to be a bad idea. E.g. registered dmabuf's,
pre-registered DMA mappings, zerocopy contexts and so on.

IOW, if the first point is solved, there may be a subset of ring
setups that can probably be CR. That should cover a good amount
of cases. I don't have a strong opinion on the whole thing,
I guess it depends on the amount of problems to implement
in-flight cancellations.
