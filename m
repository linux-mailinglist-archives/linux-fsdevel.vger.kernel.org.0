Looks syzbot hit something relevant, see
https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/0000000000000012fb05cee99477@google.com/

In short, a task creates an io_uring worker thread, then the worker
submits a task_work item to the creator task and won't die until
the item is executed/cancelled. And I found that the creator task is
sleeping in do_coredump() -> wait_for_completion()

0xffffffff81343ccb is in do_coredump (fs/coredump.c:469).
464
465             if (core_waiters > 0) {
466                     struct core_thread *ptr;
467
468                     freezer_do_not_count();
469                     wait_for_completion(&core_state->startup);
470                     freezer_count();


A hack executing tws there helps (see diff below).
Any chance anyone knows what this is and how to fix it?
