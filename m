I don't think it's that hard to write a userspace daemon that can listen
for filesystem errors via fanotify, but a messy part is going to be
adding hooks for all the filesystems that roll their own
pagecache/directio operations (e.g. nearly all of them).

Also, should userspace programs directly hook up to fanotify?  Or should
the system daemon advertise events over dbus/varlink/whatever?  It's
probably better not to have potentially large subscriber lists in the
kernel itself.
