We have an API that has existed for 10+ years. You are gatekeeping that
interface by declaring NVMe's FDP is not allowed to use it. Do I have
that wrong? You initially blocked this because you didn't like how the
spec committe worked. Now you've shifted to trying to pretend FDP
devices require explicit filesystem handholding that was explicely NOT
part of that protocol.

Your filesystem layering breaks the abstraction and capabilities the
drives are providing. You're doing more harm than good trying to game
how the media works here.

Oh, the untested prototype that wasn't posted to any mailing list for
a serious review? The one that forces FDP to subscribe to the zoned
interface only for XFS, despite these devices being squarly in the
"conventional" SSD catagory and absolutely NOT zone devices? Despite I
have other users using other filesystems successfuly using the existing
interfaces that your prototype doesn't do a thing for? Yah, thanks...

I appreciate you put the time into getting your thoughts into actual
code and it does look very valuable for ACTUAL ZONE block devices. But
it seems to have missed the entire point of what this hardware feature
does. If you're doing low level media garbage collection with FDP and
tracking fake media write pointers, then you're doing it wrong. Please
use Open Channel and ZNS SSDs if you want that interface and stop
gatekeeping the EXISTING interface that has proven value in production
software today.

Why the fuck should I make an effort to do improve your pet project that
I don't have a customer for? They want to use the interface that was
created 10 years ago, exactly for the reason it was created, and no one
wants to introduce the risks of an untested and unproven major and
invasive filesystem and block stack change in the kernel in the near
term!
