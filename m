Good to hear.  Will there be some new fstest coming/already merged?

Hmm, well, vger and lore are still having stomach problems, so even the
resend didn't result in #5 ending up in my mailbox. :(

For the patches I haven't received, I'll just attach my replies as
comments /after/ each patch subject line.  What a way to review code!

(Yeah, I guess these changes make sense...)

The commit message references a file_modified_async function, but all I
see is file_modified_flags?  Assuming that's just a clerical error,

Hm, ok, so the EAGAINs that we sprinkle everywhere get turned into short
writes at the end of iomap_file_buffered_write, and that's what this
picks up?  If so, then...
