Yep, as they say it's about all the "inventive" transformations
compilers can do, double read is just one of those that may turn very
nasty for us.

One big difference for me is whether it have a potential to crash the
kernel or not, though it's just one side.

Compilers can't drop the check just because, it first should be proven
to be safe to do, and there are all sorts barriers around and
limitations on how CQEs and SQEs are used, making impossible to alias
memory. E.g. CQEs and SQEs can't be reused in a single syscall, they're
only written and read respectively, and so on. Maybe, the only one I'd
worry about is the call to io_commit_sqring(), i.e. for SQE reads not
happening after it, but we need to take a look whether it's
theoretically possible.
