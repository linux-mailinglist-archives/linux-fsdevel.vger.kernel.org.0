I had a patch like that but some filesystems create inodes that
explicitly remove IOP_XATTR to prevent any xattrs from being set on
specific inodes. I remember this for at least reiserfs and btrfs.

So we would probably need IOP_NOACL that can be raised by a filesystem
to explicitly opt out of them for specific inodes. That's probably fine
and avoids having to introduce something like SB_I_XATTR.
