So the tricky part is the uniqueness requirement drm has for buffer
objects (and hence dma_buf wrappers), which together with the refcounting
makes dma_buf quite tricky:

- dma_buf needs to hold some reference onto the underlying object, or it
  wont work

- but you're not allowed to just create a new dma_buf every time someone
  exports an underlying object to a dma_buf, because that would break the
  uniqueness requirement. Which means the underlying object must also hold
  some kind of reference to its dma_buf, if it exists. So that on buffer
  export it can just increment the refcount for that and return it,
  instead of creating a new one.

Which would be a reference loop that never gets freed, so you need one of
two tricks:

- Either a weak reference, i.e. just a pointer plus
  atomic_inc_unless_zero trickery like ttm does. Splitting that refcount
  into more refcounts doesn't fundamentally solve the problem, it just
  adds even more refcounts.

- Or you do what all other drm drivers do in drm_prime.c do and careful
  clean up the dma_buf re-export cache when the userspace references (but
  not all kernel internal ones) disappear, to unbreak that reference loop.
  This needs to be done with extreme care and took a lot of screaming to
  get right, because if you have a race you might end up breaking the
  uniqueness requirement and have two dma_buf floating around.

So neither of these solutions really are simple, but I agree with you that
the atomic_inc_unless_zero trickery is less simple. It's definitely not
cool that it's done by digging around in struct file internals.
