ioctl(BLKBSZSET), I guess?  That currently limits to PAGE_SIZE, but I
think we can remove that limitation with the bs>PS patches.

If you're talking about "regular unaligned buffered writes", then that
won't break.  If you cross a folio boundary, the result may be torn,
but if you're crossing a block boundary you expect that.

Do untorn writes actually exist in SCSI?  I was under the impression
nobody had actually implemented them in SCSI hardware.

The problem is that keeping track of that is expensive for buffered
writes.  It's a model that only works for direct IO.  Arguably we
could make it work for O_SYNC buffered IO, but that'll require some
surgery.
