Sure. Essentially, the sysfs shrink interface is not complete. It allows
the root cache to be shrunk, but not any of the memcg caches.Â 

The same can also be said for others slab sysfs files which show current
cache status. I don't think sysfs files are created for the memcg
caches, but I may be wrong. In many cases, information can be available
elsewhere like the slabinfo file. The shrink operation, however, has no
other alternative available.

Yes, I can make it into a bit fields of 2 bits, just like
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.
