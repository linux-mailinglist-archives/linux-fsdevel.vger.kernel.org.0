I think we are talking about the same thing, actually. See below patch.
This changes it so that any error that occurs on behalf of a specific
sqe WILL trigger a completion event, instead of returning it through
io_uring_enter(). io_uring_enter() can still return -ERROR for errors
that aren't specific to an sqe.

I think this is what you had in mind?

Totally untested, will do so now.
