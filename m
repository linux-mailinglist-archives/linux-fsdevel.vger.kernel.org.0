Yes.  I don't think think raw syscall level access to the zone append
primitive makes sense.  Either use zonefs for a file-like API, or
use the NVMe pass through interface for 100% raw access.

inode_dio_wait is a really bad implementation of almost a lock.  I've
started some work that I need to finish to just replace it with proper
non-owner rwsems (or even the range locks Dave has been looking into).

O_APPEND pretty much implies out of order, as there is no way for an
application to know which thread wins the race to write the next chunk.
