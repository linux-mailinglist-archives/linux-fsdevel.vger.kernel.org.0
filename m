Sorry, I'm not familiar with lockdep implementation, here I wonder why you say
it can't trigger any deadlocks, looking at that the syzbot report, seems that
the deadlock may happen.

And I also wonder whether spin lock bh variants are enough, normal ios are
completed in interrupt context,
==> io_complete_rw
====> __io_complete_rw
======> io_complete_rw_common
========> __io_req_complete
==========> io_put_req
============> io_free_req
==============> __io_free_req
================> io_dismantle_req
==================> io_put_file
====================> percpu_ref_put(req->fixed_file_refs);
                       if we drop the last reference here,
                       io_file_data_ref_zero() will be called,
                       then we'll call spin_lock(&data->lock);
                       in interrupt context.

Should we use spin lock irq variants?
