Umm...  Why do you bother with that wrapper?  filename_lookup() is already
there and already non-static.  Granted, its user outside of fs/namei.c
is ugly as hell, but looking at this series, I'd rather have the damn
thing call filename_lookup() directly.  _Or_, if you really feel like
doing that wrapper, make it inline in internal.h and have fs_parser.c
use call the same thing - it also passes NULL as the last argument.

Said that, I really don't see the point of having that wrapper in the
first place.
