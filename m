Yes, agreed.

No, I don't think unmount notification requires looking at the inode and it
is inotify-specific thing as Amir wrote. We do require inode access when
generating fanotify events (to open fd where event happened) but that gets
handled separately by creating struct path when event happens and using it
for dentry_open() later when reporting to userspace so that carries its own
set on dentry + mnt references while the event is waiting in the queue.

Yes, I agree such scheme should be possible although a small snag I see is
that we need to keep in fsnotify mark enough info so that it can be
associated with an inode when it is read from the disk. And this info is
filesystem specific with uncertain size for filesystems which use iget5().
So I suspect we'll need some support from individual filesystems which is
always tedious.

Right, I was not precise here. We don't need a list of tracked inodes. We
are fine with a list of all marks for inodes on a superblock which we could
crawl on umount.

I agree. If fsnotify marks stop pinning inodes, we'll probably win much
more memory by keeping inodes reclaimable than we loose by extra overhead
of the mark tracking.

Ho, hum, possibly yes. I need to think a bit more about this.

This is again for handling quotaon on already mounted filesystem. We
initialize quotas for the inode when opening a file so if some files are
already open when we do quotaon, we want to attach quota structures to
these inodes. I think this was kind of important to limit mismatch between
real usage and accounted usage when old style quotas were used e.g. for
root filesystem but to be fair this code was there when I became quota
maintainer in 1999 and I never dared to remove it :)

True.
