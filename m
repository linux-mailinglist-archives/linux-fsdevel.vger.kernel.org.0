As said in the cover letter my main motivation really is simplifying the
userspace application:
 - style-wise, mixing in plain old getdents(2) or readdir(3) in the
middle of an io_uring handling loop just feels wrong; but this may just
be my OCD talking.
 - in my understanding io_uring has its own thread pool, so even if the
actual getdents is blocking other IOs can progress (assuming there is
less blocked getdents than threads), without having to build one's own
extra thread pool next to the uring handling.
Looking at io_uring/fs.c the other "metadata related" calls there also
use the synchronous APIs (renameat, unlinkat, mkdirat, symlinkat and
linkat all do), so I didn't think of that as a problem in itself.

I believe that can be done without any change of this API, so that'll be
a very welcome addition when it is ready; I don't think the adding the
uring op should wait on this if we can agree a simple wrapper API is
good enough (or come up with a better one if someone has a Good Idea)

(looking at io_uring/rw.c for comparison, io_getdents() will "just" need
to be adjusted to issue an async req if IO_URING_F_NONBLOCK is set, and
the poll/retry logic sorted out)

Thanks,
