Are you the same guy who was just posting this on Phoronix? Either
you're trolling, or you misread something.

For the record, I'm one of the more anti CoC people out there - I agree
with the spirit of their goals, not so much the approach. I would never
invoke them on anyone; I prefer to talk things out (and I don't mind
getting flamed, so long as it doesn't get in the way of the work).
