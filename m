Use the scoped APIs, people!  GFP_NOFS needs to die.  If your filesystem
cannot tolerate being reentered, call memalloc_nofs_save() / restore()
when it can tolerate being reentered.

I'd really like page cache write completions to not be handled in
the interrupt handler.  Then we could make the i_pages lock not an
interrupt-disabling lock any more.  I think that'd best be handled in a
workqueue too, but maybe there's a better solution nowadays.
