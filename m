That's fine, some tests already depend on root for certain things, like
passthrough. When I run the tests, I do a pass as both a regular user
and as root. The important bit is just that the tests skip when they are
not root rather than fail.

Arguably /dev/zero should still support splice_read() as a regression
fix as I argued to Linus, so I'd just add that as a prep patch.

This is part of the confusion, as you treat it basically like a
read/write internally, but the opcode names indicate differently. Why
not just have a separate prep helper for these and then use a layout
that makes more sense, surely rwflags aren't applicable for these
anyway? I think that'd make it a lot cleaner.

Yeah, addr3 could easily be used, but it's makes for a really confusing
command structure when the command is kinda-read but also kinda-splice.
And it arguable makes more sense to treat it as the latter, as it takes
the two fds like splice.
