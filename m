Dmitry,

If Jens prefers to just run with the conversion of do_mkdirat() and
ignore the rest that's quite alright of course. But I really appreciate
the time spent on the additional conversions.
One question I have is whether we shouldn't just be honest and add
support for linkat, symlinkat, and mknodat in one go instead of being
shy about it. uring does already have mkdirat, renamat2(), and we
already have open(). It seems kinda silly to delay the others... Unless
there's genuinely no interest or need of course.

Christian
