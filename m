Dear Friend,

I am sorry, but happy to inform you about my success in getting those
funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Vietnam.
Though, I tried my best to involve you in the business, but the whole
situation changed. Presently, I am in Vietnam for investment projects
with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I did not forget your
past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds
despite that it failed us some at a point.

Now, contact my secretary in Burkina Faso. His name is Mr. Milla
Smith. This is his email address; millasmith20100@gmail.com  Ask him
to send you the total of $850,000.00 (Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand
US Dollars) which I kept for your compensation for all the past
efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your
efforts at that time very much. So, feel free and get in touch with my
secretary, Mr. Milla Smith and instruct him where to send the amount
to you. Please, do let me know immediately you receive it, so that we
can share joy after all the sufferings at that time.

Finally, I=E2=80=99m very busy here, because of the investment projects whi=
ch
I and my new partner are having at hand. I had forwarded instruction
to the secretary on your behalf to receive that money. He will send
the funds to you without any delay OK. Extend my greetings to your
family.


My Best regards,
Yours brother
Mr. Abu Salam
Greetings from Vietnam
