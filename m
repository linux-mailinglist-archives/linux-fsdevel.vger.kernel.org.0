The only thing I don't like about this is that now the fault handler loses the
ability to drop the mmap sem.  I think in practice this doesn't really matter,
because we're trying to avoid doing IO while under the mmap sem, and presumably
this will have instantiated the pages to avoid the IO.

However if you use reflink this wouldn't be the case, and now we've
re-introduced the priority inversion possiblity.

I'm leaning more towards just putting the fsnotify hook in the xfs code for the
write case, and anybody else who implements their own ->fault without calling
the generic one will just have to do the same.

That being said I'm not going to die on any particular hill here, if you still
want to do the above before the ->fault() handler then I'll update my code to do
that and we can move on.  Thanks,

Josef
