It is always true at this point, would be completely broken
otherwise

Who knows. First of all, seems CONFIG_AUDIT is enabled by default
for many popular distributions, so I assume that is not compiled out.

What are use cases for audit? Always running I guess? Putting aside
compatibility problems, it sounds that with the amount of overhead
it adds there is no much profit in using io_uring in the first place.
Is that so?

__audit_uring_exit()
-> audit_filter_syscall()
  -> for (audit_list) if (...) audit_filter_rules()
    -> ...
-> audit_filter_inodes()
  -> ...

I see
