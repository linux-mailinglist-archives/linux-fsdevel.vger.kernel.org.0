Hmm...  Let's see what __d_alloc() will explicitly store into:
[*]	unsigned int d_flags;
[*]	seqcount_spinlock_t d_seq;
[*]	struct hlist_bl_node d_hash;
[*]	struct dentry *d_parent;
[*]	struct qstr d_name;
[*]	struct inode *d_inode;
	unsigned char d_iname[DNAME_INLINE_LEN];
[*]	struct lockref d_lockref;
[*]	const struct dentry_operations *d_op;
[*]	struct super_block *d_sb;
	unsigned long d_time;
[*]	void *d_fsdata;
	union {
[*]		struct list_head d_lru;
		wait_queue_head_t *d_wait;
	};
[*]	struct list_head d_child;
[*]	struct list_head d_subdirs;
	union {
		struct hlist_node d_alias;
		struct hlist_bl_node d_in_lookup_hash;
		struct rcu_head d_rcu;
	} d_u;

These are straightforward "overwrite no matter what".  ->d_time is not
initialized at all - it's fs-private, and unused for the majority
of filesystems (kernfs, nfs and vboxsf are the only users).
->d_alias/->d_in_lookup_hash/->d_rcu are also uninitialized - those
are valid only on some stages of dentry lifecycle (which is why
they can share space) and initialization is responsibility of
the places that do the corresponding state transitions.

->d_iname is the only somewhat delicate one.  I think we are OK as
it is (i.e. that having all of it zeroed out won't buy anything), but
that's not trivial.  Note that the last byte does need to be
initialized, despite the
        memcpy(dname, name->name, name->len);
        dname[name->len] = 0;
following it.

I'm not saying that getting rid of pre-zeroing the entire underlying
page is the wrong thing to do; it's just that it needs some analysis in
commit message.
