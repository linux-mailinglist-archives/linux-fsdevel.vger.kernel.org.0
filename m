The difference between the outcome for Case 2 and Case 3 is that in Case
2 the kernel is putting the folio in an active list and thus the kernel
will not try to reclaim it in near future but in Case 3, the kernel is
putting back in the list from which it is currently reclaiming meaning
the next iteration will try to reclaim the same folio.

We definitely don't want it in Case 3.

Just to be clear that we are on the same page that this scenario should
be handled in Case 2. Our difference is on how to describe the scenario.
To me the reason we are taking the path of Case 2 is because we don't
want what Case 3 is doing and thus wrote that. Anyways I don't think it
is that importatnt, use whatever working seems reasonable to you.

BTW you will need to update the comment for Case 2 which is above code
block.
