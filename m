I don't think so.

Please see the values I saw from my tests locally below.

No, from my test I can reproduce it locally very easy and almost every 
time the values were different, which were random values, just like:

0000000000040000,0000000000070000,000000000002e0000...

More detail please see https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/55421.

I am sure that for all the none zero values the lower 16 bits were 0000.
