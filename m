Actually, now that I'd looked at it a bit more...  Look:
we don't need to do *anything* in put_file_access(); just
make file_free()
        if (unlikely(f->f_mode & FMODE_BACKING))
		fput(backing_file(f)->user_file);
instead of conditional path_put().  That + change of open_backing_file()
prototype + get_file() in there pretty much eliminates the work done
in 1/3 - you don't need to mess with {get,put}_file_write_access()
at all.

I'd start with this:

struct file *vm_user_file(struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
	return vma->vm_file;
}
+ replace file = vma->vm_file; with file = vm_user_file(vma) in
the places affected by your 2/3.  That's the first (obviously
safe) commit.  Then the change of backing_file_open() combined
with making vm_user_file() do this:
	file = vma->vm_file;
	if (file && unlikely(file->f_mode & FMODE_BACKING))
		file = backing_file(file)->user_file;
	return file;

Voila.  Two-commit series, considerably smaller than your
variant...
