I'm guessing the device has a 32-bit DMA mask, and the allocation ends 
up in __dma_direct_alloc_pages() such that that adds GFP_DMA32 in order 
to try to satisfy the mask via regular page allocation. How GFP_KERNEL 
turns into GFP_NOIO, though, given that the DMA layer certainly isn't 
(knowingly) messing with __GFP_IO or __GFP_FS, is more of a mystery... I 
suppose "during resume" is the red flag there - is this worker perhaps 
trying to run too early in some restricted context before the rest of 
the system has fully woken up?

Thanks,
Robin.
