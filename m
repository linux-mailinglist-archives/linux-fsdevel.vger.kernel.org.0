The problem is that we might have swapped out the shmem folio.  So we
don't want to clear the page, but ask swap to fill the page.  The way
that currently works (see shmem_get_folio_gfp()) is to fetch the swap
entry from the page cache, allocate a new folio inside the shmem code,
then replace the swap entry with the new folio.

What I'd like to see is the generic code say "Ah, this is a shmem
inode, so it's special and the xa_value entry is swap information,
not workingset information, so I'll allocate the folio and restore
the folio->private swap information to let the shmem_read_folio
function do its job correctly".

Either that or we completely overhaul the shmem code to store the
location of its swapped data somewhere that's not the page cache.

Same problem as (a).

I've had thoughts along those lines in the past.  It's pretty major
surgery, I think.  At the moment, we allocate the pages and add them
to the page cache in a locked state before asking the filesystem to
populate them.  So the fs doesn't even have the file layout (eg the
get_block or iomap info) that would tell it where the holes are until
the page has already been allocated and inserted.  We could of course
free the page and replace it with a special 'THIS_IS_A_HOLE' entry.
It's just never seemed important enuogh to me to do this surgery.

I'd really like to see shmem have a read_folio implementation.  I
don't know how much work it's going to be.
