My guess is that fully automatically is hard/impossible as there is
lots and lots of related state that has to come back. Like how do you
get all the internal iommufs IOAS related datastructures
automatically. Seems way too hard.

Feels simpler to have userspace redo whatever setup was needed to get
back to the right spot.

Right, there is lots of state all over the place that would hard to
just re-materialize.

I expect the basic flow would be like:

 Starting kernel
   - run the VMM
   - Allocate VM memory in the pkernfs
   - mmap that VM memory
   - Attach the VM memory to KVM
   - Attach the VM memory mmap to IOMMUFD
   - Operate the VM

 Suspending the kernel
   - Stop touching iommufd
   - Freeze changes to the IOMMU, and move its working memory to pkernfs
   - Exit the kernel

 New kernel
   - Recover the frozen IOMMU back to partially running, like crash
     dump. Continue to use some of the working memory in the pkernfs
   - run the new VMM. Some IOMMU_DOMAIN_PKERNFS thing to represent
     this state
   - mmap the VM memory
   - Get KVM going again
   - Attach the new VMM's VM memory mmap to IOMMUFD
   - Replace the iommu partial configuration with a full configuration
   - Free the pkernfs iommu related memory

The only tricky bit in the above is having VFIO know it should leave
the iommu and PCI device state alone when the VFIO cdev is first
opened. Otherwise everything else is straightforward.

Presumably vfio would know it inherited a pkernfs blob and would do
the right stuff. May be some uAPI fussing there to handshake that
properly

Once VFIO knows this it can operate iommufd to conserve the
IOMMU_DOMAIN_PKERNFS as well.

In terms of how the iommu subystems understands what the iommu is
doing. The iommu subsystem now forces the iommu into defined states as
part of its startup and you need an explicit defined state which means
"continuing to use the pkernfs saved state" which the iommu driver
deliberately enters.

VFIO doesn't trigger deferred attach at all, that patch made no sense.

Because that is the software model we have now. You must be explicit
not in some lalal undefined land of "i don't know WTF is going on but
if I squint this is doing some special thing!" That concept is dead in
the iommu subsystem, you must be explicit.

If the iommu is translating through special page tables stored in a
pkernfs then you need a IOMMU_DOMAIN_PKERNFS to represent that
behavior.

Because how do you regain control of the iommu in a fully configured
way with all the right pin counts and so forth? It seems impossible
like this, all that information is washed away during the kexec.

It seems easier if the pkernfs version of the iommu configuration is
temporary and very special. The normal working mode is just exactly as
today.

Suspending preperation can be done before stopping the vCPUs. You have
to commit to freezing the iommu which only means things like memory
hotplug can't progress. So it isn't critical path

Same on resume, you can resum kvm and the vCPUs and leave the IOMMU in
its suspended state while you work on returning it to normal
operation. Again only memory hotplug becomes blocked so it isn't
critical path.

You don't mess up the entire driver and all of its memory management,
and end up with a problem where you can't actually properly restore it
anyhow :)

IMHO it doesn't matter how you get the memory across the kexec, you
still have to answer all these questions about how does the new kernel
actually keep working with this inherited data, and how does it
transform the inherited data into operating data that is properly
situated in the kernel data structures.

You can't just startup iommufd and point it at a set of io page tables
that something else populated. It is fundamentally wrong and would
lead to corrupting the mm's pin counts.

I'd think you end up with some scenario where the pkernfs data has to
be trusted and sealed somehow before vfio would understand it. Ie you
have to feed it into vfio/etc via kexec only.

From a security perspective it does seem horribly wrong to expose such
sensitive data in a filesystem API where there are API surfaces that
would let userspace manipulate it.

At least from the iommu/vfio perspective:

The trusted data should originate inside a signed kernel only.

The signed kernel should prevent userspace from reading or writing it

The next kernel should trust that the prior kernel put the correct
data in there. There should be no option for the next kernel userspace
to read or write the data.

The next kernel can automatically affiliate things with the trusted
inherited data that it knows was passed from the prior signed kernel.
eg autocreate a IOMMU_DOMAIN_PKERNFS, tweak VFIO, etc.

I understand the appeal of making a pkernfs to hold the VM's memory
pages, but it doesn't seem so secure for kernel internal data
strucures..
