Thanks a lot for your advice in this thread.

Can you (or someone else) suggest a Linux fs setup that's as unforgiving
as possible vis-a-vis fsync() for testing? I'd like to hack on making
git better at this, but one of the problems of testing it is that modern
filesystems generally do a pretty good job of not losing your data.

So something like ext4's commit=3DN is an obvious start, but for git's own
test suite it would be ideal to have process A write file X, and then
have process B try to read it and just not see it if X hadn't been
fsynced (or not see its directory if that hadn't been synced).

It would turn our test suite into pretty much a 100% failure, but one
that could then be fixed by fixing the relevant file writing code.
