I am very hesitant to define a "typical" audit configuration as it
really is dependent on the user's security requirements as well as the
particular solution/environment.  Any configuration I pick will be
"wrong" for a lot of audit users :)

As I see it, users will likely find themselves in one of three
performance buckets:

* io_uring enabled, CONFIG_AUDIT=n

For those who are already trying to get that last 1% of performance
from their kernel and are willing to give up most everything else to
get it this is the obvious choice.  Needless to say there should not
be any audit related impact in this case (especially since we've
removed that req->opcode checks prior to the audit calls).

* io_uring enabled, CONFIG_AUDIT=y, audit "task,never" runtime config

[side note: I made some tweaks to audit_uring_entry() to move the
audit_enabled check there so we no longer need to call into
__audit_uring_entry() in this fastpath case.  Similarly
audit_uring_exit() now does an audit_dummy_context() check instead of
simply checking audit_context(), this should avoid calling into
__audit_uring_exit() when the io_uring op is not being audited.]

I'm guessing that most distro users will fall into this bucket.  Here
the task's audit_context should always be NULL, both in the syscall
context and sqpoll context, so io_uring would call into the inline
audit_uring_entry() function and return without calling into
__audit_uring_entry() (see the "side note" above).  The
audit_uring_exit() call would behave in a similar manner.

* io_uring enabled, CONFIG_AUDIT=y, some sort of runtime audit config

For obvious reasons this case has the most performance impact and as
mentioned above it can vary quite a bit.  In my opinion this is the
least important bucket from a performance perspective as the user
clearly has a need for the security information that audit provides
and enabling that functionality in io_uring is critical to allowing
the user to take advantage of io_uring.  The performance of io_uring
is impacted, but it should still be more performant than synchronous
I/O and it allows the user to run their existing io_uring
applications/code-paths.

Yes, the entry/before hook does the setup for the io_uring op (very
similar to a syscall entry point) and the exit/after hook is what does
the audit record generation based on what took place during the
io_uring operation.

I'm leaving this old paragraph here because I really think this is
important to the discussion.  If we can't find a solution here we
would need to make io_uring and audit mutually exclusive and I don't
think that is in the best interests of the users, and would surely
create a headache for the distros.
