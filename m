Meh, not too excited about it. Couldn't you use a flag in s_fsnotify_mask?
Maybe that's what you mean below.

Would it make sense without incurring performance impact to move
atomic_long_t s_fsnotify_connectors and your new atomic_long_t into a
struct fsnotify_data that gets allocated when an sb is created? Then we
don't waste space in struct super_block. This is basically a copy-pasta
of the LSM sb->s_security approach.
