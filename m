Initially I mean timer_delete_sync() could be called before
do_fuse_request_end() inside fuse_request_end().  But anyway it's a
rough idea just for making the code look cleaner, without thinking if
this logic change is right or not.

I can understand now.  Thanks!

Yes, this is the only possible place where the timeout handler could
concurrently run while the request is in copying state (i.e. LOCKED).
As I described above, when connection is aborted, the LOCKED requests
will be left there and won't be finished until they are unlocked.  I'm
not sure why this special handling is needed for LOCKED requests, but I
guess it's not because of UAF issue.  From the comment of
lock_request(), "Up to the next unlock_request() there mustn't be
anything that could cause a page-fault.", though I can't understand in
which case there will be a page fault and it will be an issue.

Maybe I'm wrong.  It would be helpful if someone could shed light on this.
