I think of "Ack" to mean "I am a maintainer of this area and someone can
carry this instead of it going via my tree". While I certainly poke and
ptrace and x86 a lot, I probably wouldn't Ack in this part of the
kernel. But it does seem "Reviewed-by" is a stronger signal[1].

Regardless, v2 looks good to me still. :)
