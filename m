Hi!

I do not have device with requirements for TexFAT. The first reason why
I wanted to use TexFAT was that it it the only way how to use more FAT
tables (e.g. secondary for backup) and information for that is missing
in released exFAT specification. This could bring better data recovery.

Ok.

I was hoping that it would be possible to easily use secondary FAT table
(from TexFAT extension) for redundancy without need to implement full
TexFAT, which could be also backward compatible with systems which do
not implement TexFAT extension at all. Similarly like using FAT32 disk
with two FAT tables is possible also on system which use first FAT
table.

Currently I do not know.
