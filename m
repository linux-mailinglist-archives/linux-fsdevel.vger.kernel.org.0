While there may be uses for IORING_OP_GETDENTS are you sure your
test is comparing like with like?
The underlying work has to be done in either case, so you are
swapping system calls for code complexity.
I suspect that find is actually doing a stat() call on every
directory entry and that your io_uring example is just believing
the 'directory' flag returned in the directory entry for most
modern filesystems.

If you write a program that does openat(), readdir(), close()
for each directory and with a long enough buffer (mostly) do
one readdir() per directory you'll get a much better comparison.

You could even write a program with 2 threads, one does all the
open/readdir/close system calls and the other does the printing
and generating the list of directories to process.
That should get the equivalent overlapping that io_uring gives
without much of the complexity.
