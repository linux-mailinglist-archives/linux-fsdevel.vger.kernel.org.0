Is this because RocksDB already does seggregation per file itself? Are
you doing something specific on XFS or using your knoledge on RocksDB to
map files with an "unwritten" protocol in the midde?

    In this context, we have collected data both using FDP natively in
    RocksDB and using the temperatures. Both look very good, because both
    are initiated by RocksDB, and the FS just passes the hints directly
    to the driver.

I ask this to understand if this is the FS responsibility or the
application's one. Our work points more to letting applications use the
hints (as the use-cases are power users, like RocksDB). I agree with you
that a FS could potentially make an improvement for legacy applications
- we have not focused much on these though, so I trust you insights on
it.

Please, see the message I responded on the other thread. I hope it is a
way to move forward and actually work together on this.
