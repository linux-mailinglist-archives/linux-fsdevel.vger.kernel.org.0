AFAICT it is safe to do this. Lockdep just needs to be bashed about
the head a bit to make it shut up.

Nah, I screwed up backing out a change. This line should not be
modified at all.

Looks like rebase failure fallout. I must have missed it on
cleanup. I'll sort that out.

I'll put a refacting patch at the start of the series to split this
into separate code movement and algorithm modification patches....
