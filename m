There's a fairly large amount of that on github, google spectre poc and
stuff like that.

Gadget scanners are ever evolving and I think there's a bunch of groups
running them against Linux, but most of us don't have spare time beyond
trying to plug the latest hole.

Objtool does not look for these (gadget scanners are quite complicated
by now and I don't think I want to go there with objtool). At the moment
I'm simply fixing whatever gets reported from 3rd parties when and where
time permits.

The thing at hand was just me eyeballing it.

Right, but then you get into the problem that Rust simply cannot express
a fair amount of the things we already do, like asm-goto, or even simple
asm with memops apparently.

Yeah, LLVM-IR. And urgh yeah, CPP, this is another down-side of Rust not
being in the C language family, you can't sanely run CPP on it. Someone
really should do a Rust like language in the C family, then perhaps it
will stop looking like line noise to me :-)

I suppose converting things to enum and inline functions where possible
might help a bit with that, but things like tracepoints, which are built
from a giant pile of CPP are just not going to be happy :/

Anyway, I think it would be a giant step forwards from where we are
today.

But does LTO make any guarantees about inlining? The thing is, with
actual LLVM-IR you can express the __always_inline attribute and
inlining becomes guaranteed, I don't think you can rely on LTO for the
same level of guarantees.

And you still need to create these C functions by hand in this
local-LTO scenario, which is less than ideal.
