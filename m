Another thing to know is that dump_interrupted() isn't only called from
do_coredump().

At first, I did the mistake to think that if dump_interrupt() was
returning false when called from do_coredump() all was good.

It is not the case. dump_interrupted() is also called from dump_emit()
which is called from several places by functions inside binfmt_elf.c

So dump_interrupted() is called several times during the coredump
generation.
