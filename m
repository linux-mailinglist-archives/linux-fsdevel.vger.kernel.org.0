Yeah, I was too lazy to do it all and I don't have a setup to test the
patch quickly either. BTW, my hack is missing an access_ok() check.

I wonder whether copy_{to,from}_user_nofault() could actually return the
number of bytes left to copy, just like their non-nofault counterparts.
These are only used in a few places, so fairly easy to change. If we go
for a btrfs fix along the lines of my diff, it saves us from duplicating
the copy_to_user_nofault() code.
