Just tag it with EXPERIMENTAL on recpetion of the first
REQ_OP_PROVISION for the device (i.e. dump a log warning), like I'll
end up doing with XFS when it detects provisioning support at mount
time.

We do this all the time to allow merging new features before they
are fully production ready - EXPERIMENTAL means you can expect it to
mostly work, except when it doesn't, and you know that when it
breaks you get to report the bug, help triage it and as a bonus you
get to keep the broken bits!

$ git grep EXPERIMENTAL fs/xfs
fs/xfs/Kconfig:   This feature is considered EXPERIMENTAL.  Use with caution!
fs/xfs/Kconfig:   This feature is considered EXPERIMENTAL.  Use with caution!
fs/xfs/scrub/scrub.c: "EXPERIMENTAL online scrub feature in use. Use at your own risk!");
fs/xfs/xfs_fsops.c:     "EXPERIMENTAL online shrink feature in use. Use at your own risk!");
fs/xfs/xfs_super.c:     xfs_warn(mp, "DAX enabled. Warning: EXPERIMENTAL, use at your own risk");
fs/xfs/xfs_super.c:     "EXPERIMENTAL Large extent counts feature in use. Use at your own risk!");
fs/xfs/xfs_xattr.c: "EXPERIMENTAL logged extended attributes feature in use. Use at your own risk!");
$

IOWs, I'll be adding a:

"EXPERIMENTAL block device provisioning in use. Use at your own risk!"

warning to XFS, and it won't get removed until both the XFS and
dm-thinp support is solid and production ready....

Cheers,

Dave.
