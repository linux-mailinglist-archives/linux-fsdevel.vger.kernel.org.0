Where's the filesystem support? You need to plumb in ext4 to this
bufferhead support, and add iomap/xfs support as well so we can
shake out all the problems with APIs and fallback paths that are
needed for full support of buffered writes via io_uring.

That's ugly, especially at the filesystem/iomap layer where we are
doing delayed allocation and so partial writes like this could have
significant extra impact. It opens up the possibility of things like
ENOSPC/EDQUOT mid-way through the write instead of being an up-front
error, and so there's lots more complexity in the failure/fallback
paths that the io_uring infrastructure will have to handle
correctly...

Also, it breaks the "atomic buffered write" design of iomap/XFS
where other readers and writers will only see whole completed writes
and not intermediate partial writes. This is where a lot of the bugs
in the DIO io_uring support were found (deadlocks, data corruptions,
etc), so there's a bunch of semantic and API issues that filesystems
require from io_uring that need to be sorted out before we think
about merge buffered write support...

Cheers,

Dave.
