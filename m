Firstly this FS flag isn't available, if it is added, we may take it into
account, and it is just one check, which shouldn't be blocker for this
loop perf improvement.

Secondly it isn't enough to replace nowait decision from user side, one
case is overwrite, which is a nice usecase for nowait.

As I mentioned the hint in this patch is very loop specific for avoiding
potential write perf regression, which just works for loop's case.

It can't be applied on io-uring, otherwise perf regression can be caused on
overwrite from io-uring application.

So I don't know what is the exact common code or logic for both loop and
io-uring.
