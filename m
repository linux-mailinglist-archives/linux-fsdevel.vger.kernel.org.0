The block_device driver has to opt-in to this feature. If a multi-device block
driver wants to opt-in to this, then it would be responsible to handle
translating that driver's specific cookie to whatever representation the
drivers it stacks atop require. Otherwise, the cookie threaded through the bio
is an opque value: nothing between io_uring and the block_device driver need to
decode it.

If the block_device doesn't support providing this cookie, then io_uring just
falls back to the existing less optimal methond, and all will continue to work
as it does today.
