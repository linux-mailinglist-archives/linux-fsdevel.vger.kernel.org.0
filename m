To elaborate: ->release() instance may not assume anything about current->mm,
or assume anything about current, for that matter.  It is entirely possible
to arrange its execution in context of a process that is not yours and had not
consent to doing that.  In particular, it's a hard bug to have _any_ visible
effects depending upon the memory mappings, memory contents or the contents of
descriptor table of the process in question.

There's really no way around that.
