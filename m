We are all upstream developers here. And Ming is among the best of us,
so please try to stay constructive.

You now have the full bug report (I provided the reproducer and
additonal context, and now Ming shared the "Increasing read ahead is
not an option..." detail from the original report).

BUT Ming did mention the potential for mixed workload in his original
RFC patch header:

And while both you and Dave rightly seized on the seemingly "Doctor it
hurts when I clamp readahead to be small but then issue larger
sequential reads and want it to use larger readahead" aspect of this
report...

Dave was helpful with his reasoned follow-up responses, culminating
with this one (where the discussion evolved to clearly consider the
fact that an integral part of addressing the reported issue is the
need to allow for mixed workloads not stomping on each other when
issuing IO to the same backing block device):

Anyway, if we could all keep cool and just finish the discussion about
how to address the reported issue in a long-term supported way that'd
be _awesome_.

While I'm sure this legacy application would love to not have to
change its code at all, I think we can all agree that we need to just
focus on how best to advise applications that have mixed workloads
accomplish efficient mmap+read of both sequential and random.

To that end, I heard Dave clearly suggest 2 things:

1) update MADV/FADV_SEQUENTIAL to set file->f_ra.ra_pages to
   bdi->io_pages, not bdi->ra_pages * 2

2) Have the application first issue MADV_SEQUENTIAL to convey that for
   the following MADV_WILLNEED is for sequential file load (so it is
   desirable to use larger ra_pages)

This overrides the default of bdi->io_pages and _should_ provide the
required per-file duality of control for readahead, correct?

Thanks,
Mike
