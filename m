I just realized that I missed one noteworthy aspect of our use case. We
would be alright if this functionality to bypass the mounter's cred
checks (conditional, based on a mount option) was only allowed for
read-only overlays[1].

I'm not sure if that would meet the needs of Android. Can you comment on
that, Mark?

Miklos, would that restriction make this series any more acceptable to

Thanks!
