Reword / reorganize things a little bit into "lists", so new features /
modes / ioctls can sort of just be appended.

Describe how UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR and UFFDIO_CONTINUE can be used
to intercept and resolve minor faults. Make it clear that COPY and
ZEROPAGE are used for MISSING faults, whereas CONTINUE is used for MINOR
faults.

+Resolving Userfaults
+--------------------
+
+There are three basic ways to resolve userfaults:
+
+- ``UFFDIO_COPY`` atomically copies some existing page contents from
+  userspace.
+
+- ``UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE`` atomically zeros the new page.
+
+- ``UFFDIO_CONTINUE`` maps an existing, previously-populated page.
+
+These operations are atomic in the sense that they guarantee nothing can
+see a half-populated page, since readers will keep userfaulting until the
+operation has finished.
+
+By default, these wake up userfaults blocked on the range in question.
+They support a ``UFFDIO_*_MODE_DONTWAKE`` ``mode`` flag, which indicates
+that waking will be done separately at some later time.
+
+Which ioctl to choose depends on the kind of page fault, and what we'd
+like to do to resolve it:
+
+- For ``UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING`` faults, the fault needs to be
+  resolved by either providing a new page (``UFFDIO_COPY``), or mapping
+  the zero page (``UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE``). By default, the kernel would map
+  the zero page for a missing fault. With userfaultfd, userspace can
+  decide what content to provide before the faulting thread continues.
+
+- For ``UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR`` faults, there is an existing page (in
+  the page cache). Userspace has the option of modifying the page's
+  contents before resolving the fault. Once the contents are correct
+  (modified or not), userspace asks the kernel to map the page and let the
+  faulting thread continue with ``UFFDIO_CONTINUE``.
 
 Notes:
 
-- If you requested ``UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING`` when registering then
-  you must provide some kind of page in your thread after reading from
-  the uffd.  You must provide either ``UFFDIO_COPY`` or ``UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE``.
-  The normal behavior of the OS automatically providing a zero page on

+- You can tell which kind of fault occurred by examining
+  ``pagefault.flags`` within the ``uffd_msg``, checking for the
