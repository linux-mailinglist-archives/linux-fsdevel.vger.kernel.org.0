Agreed. But if I got it right, you are open to support both in-the-sqe
command (<= 56 bytes) and out-of-sqe command (> 56 bytes) with this
interface.
Driver processing the ioctl can fetch the cmd from user-space in one
case (as it does now), and skips in another.

Sounds good, I will start with the latest branch that you posted. Thanks.
