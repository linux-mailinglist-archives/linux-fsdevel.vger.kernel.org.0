If we cross into a new filesystem on the server, then the client will also
cross and leave the "root" and have a new sb with non-zero fsid.

This isn't what I'm worried about.  I'm worried about the case where an nfs
client will have multiple mounts with fsid's of 0:0, and those are
distinctly different mounts of the "root" of NFSv4 on different servers.

Yes, it should represent the same filesystem on the server.  You could still
get duplicates between servers. What's returned in the protocol's u64 fsid
goes into major with minor always zero.

I'm sure there was discussion about what implementations should use long
ago, but that predates me.

> - For NFSv4 mount of a specific export, f_fsid is a good identifier?

Yes, but if the specific export is on the same server's filesystem as the
"root", you'll still get zero.  There are various ways to set fsid on
exports for linux servers, but the fsid will be the same for all exports of
the same filesystem on the server.

> - For the NFSv4 root export mount, f_fsid remains zero as it is now

Yes.

I think so.

I'm not familiar with fanotify enough to know if having multiple fsid 0
mounts of different filesystems on different servers will do the right
thing.  I wanted to point out that very real possibility for v4.
