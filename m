Yes, that was a problem with v11 and prior because the client was
holding a reference on the nfsd_file's underlying file (nf->nf_file)
for the duration of the open (within nfs_open_ctx).  That client-side
caching of the open file was done for performance reasons, but with
client-side use of nfsd_file we can claw back ~50% of that performance
by using the filecache's GC (patch 23 in this series details the
comparative performance numbers I'm talking about).

So I removed that extra client-side reference entirely, and just rely
on nfsd's filecache to hold the file open by nfsd_file_acquire_local()
taking reference on nfsd_file (so server does the normal thing on
shutdown where it walks the filecache's hlist during shutdown).

No, I've been testing it manually:

Client is using localio for /mnt/test2:

# python3
>>> f = open("/mnt/test2/testfile", encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
>>> s = f.read(8)
>>>

Server (happens to be running in container) is shutdown:

podman exec -ti nfs_12 /bin/bash
[root@6baf567b559a /]# systemctl stop nfs-server.service
[root@6baf567b559a /]# umount /export/cvol_12_0

(even easier to test without server in a container)

Yes, that is how it works: exactly like remote NFSv3.
