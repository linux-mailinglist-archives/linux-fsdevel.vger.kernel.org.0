Oh hm, then maybe just a regular read at the end would work. As soon as
userspace send us anything or we get a close event we just disconnect.

But btw, I think we really need a recvmsg() flag that allows a receiver
to refuse SCM_RIGHTS/file descriptors from being sent to it. IIRC, right
now this is a real issue that systemd works around by always calling its
cmsg_close_all() helper after each recvmsg() to ensure that no one sent
it file descriptors it didn't want. The problem there is that someone
could have sent it an fd to a hanging NFS server or something and then
it would hang in close() even though it never even wanted any file
descriptors in the first place.

No, the file descriptors are still open.

Yeah, I namespaced that thing. :)

I think that's policy that I absolute don't want the kernel to get
involved in unless absolutely necessary. A few days ago I just discussed
this at length with Lennart and the issue is that systemd would want to
see all coredumps on the system independent of the namespace they're
created in. To have a per-namespace (userns/mountns/netns) coredump
socket would invalidate that one way or the other and end up hiding
coredumps from the administrator unless there's some elaborate scheme
where it doesn't.

systemd-coredump (and Apport fwiw) has infrastructure to forward
coredumps to individual services and containers and it's already based
on AF_UNIX afaict. And I really like that it's the job of userspace to
deal with this instead of the kernel having to get involved in that
mess.

So all of this should be relative to the initial namespace. I want a
separate security hook though so an LSMs can be used to prevent
processes from connecting to the coredump socket.

My idea has been that systemd-coredump could use a bpf lsm program that
would allow to abort a coredump before the crashing process connects to
the socket and again make this a userspace policy issue.
