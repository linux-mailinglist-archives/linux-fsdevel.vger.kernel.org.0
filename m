Just to expand on that a bit - part of struct io_kiocb is per-command
data, and we try pretty hard to keep that at 64-bytes as that's the
largest one we currently have. If we add the array to the io_xattr
structure, then that will increase the whole io_kiocb from 224 bytes to
more than twice that.

So there are really two options here:

1) The xattr_ctx structure goes into the async data that a command has
   to allocate for deferred execution. This isn't a _huge_ deal as we
   have to defer the xattr commands for now anyway, as the VFS doesn't
   support a nonblocking version of that yet. But it would still be nice
   not to have to do that.

2) We keep the original interface that Stefan proposed, leaving the
   xattr_ctx bits embedded as they fit fine like that.

#2 would be a bit more efficient, but I don't feel that strongly about
it for this particular case.

Comments?
