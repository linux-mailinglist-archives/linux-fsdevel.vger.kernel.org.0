Sure, that seems like more precise context with which to train
lockdep.

I obviously have no issues with Neil confirming/expanding what I
shared about the need for checking uuid->net with RCU held to ensure
it safe to call this nfs_to method.  Without it we cannot make the
call, which happens to then take other references (nfsd_serv and
nfsd_file) that we can then lean on for the duration of the NFS client
issuing IO and then dropping the references/interlock when completing
the IO.

The NFS client maintainers need to give a good review anyway, so
plenty of time for Neil to weigh in.

Thanks,
Mike
