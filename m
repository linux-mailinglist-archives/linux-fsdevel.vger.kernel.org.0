Sure, but we have no way of telling what semantics the IO issuer
actually requires from above. And because IOCB_NOWAIT behaviour is
directly exposed to userspace by RWF_NOWAIT, that's the behaviour we
have to implement.

Yup, perhaps what we really want is a true IOCB_NONBLOCK flag as an
internal kernel implementation. i.e. don't block anywhere in the
stack, and the caller must handle retrying/completing the entire IO
regardless of where the -EAGAIN comes from during the IO, including
from a partial completion that the caller is waiting for...

i.e. rather than hacking around this specific instance of "it blocks
and we don't want it to", define the semantics and behaviour of a
fully non-blocking IO through all layers from the VFS down to the
hardware and let's implement that. Then we can stop playing
whack-a-mole with all the "but it blocks when I do this, doctor!"
issues that we seem to keep having.... :)

Cheers,

Dave.
