... from fstests project, for a patch on a linux-$FSTYP project?

That's weird to me.

I think a specific fs test lead is a contributer for that fs project more,
not for fstests. The test lead need to report test results to that fs
project, not necessary to report to fstests.

And a test lead might do more testing besides fstests. So I can't imagine
that I need to check another project to learn about who's in charge of the
current project I'm changing.

(If I understood anything wrong, please correct me:)
