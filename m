Huh yes, didn't even notice that it's missing a few.

Me too, and the fact that email is getting worse and worse is not making
things any better...

Yes, hch did review the whole thing prior to v9. v9 has been pretty
quiet, but even v8 didn't have a whole lot. Which is to be expected for
a v9, this thing has been going for months.

We're only at -rc3 right now, so I think it's fine getting it some -next
exposure. It's not like it's getting pushed tomorrow, and if actual
concerns arise, let's just deal with them if that's the case. I'll check
in with folks before anything gets pushed certainly, I just don't think
it's fair to keep stalling when there are no real objections. Nothing
gets pushed unless the vested parties agree, obviously.
