At the point where this test takes place we are already in the audit
slow path as far as io_uring is concerned.  I understand your concern,
but the advantage of being able to effectively use io_uring in the
future makes this worth keeping in my opinion.

Sounds like we are in agreement.  We'll keep it for now.

Sure, that's reasonable.

I see them, thank you, comments will follow over there.  Although to
be honest I'm mostly focusing on the testing right now while we wait
to hear back from Jens on what he is willing to accept regarding audit
calls in io_issue_sqe().  If we can't do the _entry()/_exit() calls
then this work is pretty much dead and we just have to deal with it in
Kconfig.  I might make one last, clean patchset and put it in a branch
for the distros that want to carry the patchset, but it isn't clear to
me that it is something I would want to maintain long term.  Long
running out of tree patches are generally A Bad Idea.

Perhaps I'm misunderstand you, but that scenario really shouldn't
exist.  The io_uring ops function independently of syscalls; you can
*submit* io_uring ops via io_uring_enter(), but they are not
guaranteed to be dispatched synchronously (obviously), and given the
cred shenanigans that can happen with io_uring there is no guarantee
the filters would even be applicable.

It isn't an issue of "can" the filters be separate, they *have* to be separate.
