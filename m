It isn't as you now realized but I'm glad we cleared that up off-list.

(Prefix: Imagine me calmly writing this and in a relaxed tone.)

Just to clarify. I do think that deciding that 0 is an invalid file
descriptor number is weird and I wish you'd have discussed this with us
before you took that decision. You've seen the reaction that other
low-level userspace people you talked to had to these news...

I'm not sure what to make of the POSIX excursion. I think that it is a
complete sideshow to the issue here in a way. But fwiw...

We don't follow arbitrary conventions such as 0, 1, and 2 because we all
have sworn allegiance to The Secret Order of the POSIX but because the
alternative is that one subsystem finds it neat to use fd 0 to refer to
AT_FDCWD and another one to AT_MY_CUSTOM_FD0_MEANING. Which is exactly
what would've happened if this patch would have made it unnoticed.

This doesn't scale and our interfaces aren't designed around
Shakespeare's dictum "What's in a name?".

This will quickly devolve into a situation similar to letting a step on
a staircase be off by a few millimeters. See those users falling.

I'm glad we cleared this up. My main issue is indeed that fd 0 now isn't
just forbidden it would be given an entirely different meaning which is
not acceptable from the vfs perspective.
