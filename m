Hi Ric,

I think being able to specify workload using fio will be very useful
regardless if we'll end up with with a standalone discard testing tool
or not.

A long time ago I wrote a tool for testing discaed performance. You can
find it here. Keep in mind that it was really long time ago since I even
looked at it, so not sure if it still even compiles.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/test-discard/

You can go through the README file to see what it does but in summary
you can:

- specify size of discard request
- specify range of discard request size to test
- discard already discarded blocks
- can test with sequential or random pattern
- for every discard request size tested it will give you results like

<record_size> <total_size> <min> <max> <avg> <sum> <throughput in MB/s>

Yes, usefull. Also note that a long time ago when I've done the testing
I noticed that after a discard request, especially after whole device
discard, the read/write IO performance went down significanly for some
drives. I am sure things have changed, but I think it would be
interesting to see how does it behave now.

From my testing (again it was long time ago and things probably changed
since then) most of the drives I've seen had largely the same or similar
timing for discard request regardless of the size (hence, the conclusion
was the bigger the request the better). A small variation I did see
could have been explained by kernel implementation and discard_max_bytes
limitations as well.

I think that all of the above will be interesting. However there are two
sides of it. One is just pure discard performance to figure out what
could be the expectations and the other will be "real" workload
performance. Since from my experience discard can have an impact on
drive IO performance beyond of what's obvious, testing mixed workload
(IO + discard) is going to be very important as well. And that's where
fio workloads can come in (I actually do not know if fio already
supports this or not).
