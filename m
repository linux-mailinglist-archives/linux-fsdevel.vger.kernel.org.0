And that also would allow supporting a fake copy offload with regular read/write
BIOs very easily, I think. So all block devices can be presented as supporting
"copy offload". That is nice for FSes.

ATA WRITE GATHERED command is also a single copy command. That matches and while
I have not checked SAT, translation would likely work.

While I was initially worried that the 2 BIO based approach would be overly
complicated, it seems that I was wrong :)
