Well, we call balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited() after each page. So it does
not really matter much if the sleep is pushed to happen one page later.
balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited() does ratelimiting of when
balance_dirty_pages() are called so we have to make sure
current->nr_dirtied is not zeroed out before we really do wait (because
that is what determines whether we enter balance_dirty_pages() and how long
we sleep there) but looking at the code that should work out just fine.
