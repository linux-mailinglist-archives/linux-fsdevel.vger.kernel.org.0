You should run Unsquashfs on the host Ubuntu PC to verify
the integrity of the Squashfs image before transferring and
flashing.

Unsquashfs is in the squashfs-tools package on Ubuntu.  To install
run as root

% apt-get install squashfs-tools

Then run it on your Squashfs image

% unsquashfs <your image>

If the image is uncorrupted, it will unpack the image into
"squashfs-root".  If it is corrupted it will give error
messages.

I have not used the MTD subsystem for more than 13 years, and so
this is best answered on linux-mtd.  There may be some specfic
UBI/MTD tools available now to do integrity checking.

But failing that, and presuming you have character device access
to the flashed partition, you can "dd" the image out of the flash
into a file, and then run a checksum program against it.

You appear to be running busybox, and this has both support for
"dd" and the "md5sum" checksum program.

So do this

% dd if=<your character device> of=img bs=1 count=<image size>

Where <image size> is the size of the Squashfs image reported
by "ls -l" or "stat".  You need to get the exact byte count
right, otherwise the resultant checksum won't be right.

Then run md5sum on the extracted "img" file.

% md5sum img

This will produce a checksum.

You can then compare that with the result of "md5sum" on your
original Squashfs image before flashing (produced on the host
or the target).

If the checksums differ then it is corrupted.

This implies there is corruption being introduced at the MTD level or
below.
