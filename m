As I wrote before, IMHO, local filesystems read data in some basic
unit (for example block size), if there are other irreverent metadata
read in one shot, of course it can read together.

Some local filesystems could read more related metadata when reading
inodes.  But that is based on the logical relationship rather than
the in-kernel readahead algorithm.

I don't think in-tree EROFS should do a random irreverent readahead
like kernel_read() without proof since it could have bad results to
small random file access.  If we do such thing, I'm afraid it's
also irresponsible to all end users already using EROFS in production.

Again, "ls -lR" is not the whole world, no? If you care about the
startup time, FAST 16 slacker implied only 6.4% of that data [1] is
read.  Even though it mainly told about lazy pulling, but that number
is almost the same as the startup I/O in our cloud containers too.
