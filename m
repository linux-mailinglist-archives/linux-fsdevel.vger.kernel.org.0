OK, I agree that for nfsd reporting the event with the mount that nfsd exports
would make sense.

So this would be controversial I think. Mounts can have different
properties (like different read-only settings, different id mappings, ...),
can reveal different parts of the filesystem and generally will be
differently placed in mount hierarchy. So in particular with sb marks the
implications of arbitrarily combining mount of a sb with some random dentry
(which need not even be accesible through the mount) could lead to surprising
results.

Yeah, I'm not that concerned about keeping the fs busy. After all we
currently grab inode references and drop them on umount and we could do the
same with whatever other references we have to the fs.

Yes, reporting error for unpopulated content would be acceptable behavior.
I just don't see this would be all that useful.

I agree it is kind of elegant. But I find reporting DFID and leaving upto
userspace to provide "ignored" mount to fill in the contents elegant as
well and there's no need to define behavior of O_PATH dir fds with NONOTIFY
flags.

I agree FAN_REPORT_DIR_FD doesn't have this problem and that certainly adds
some appeal to it:). OTOH it is not that hard to solve - you'd need some
idr allocator in the notification group and pass the identifier together
with the event.

As I wrote in my first email what I'd like to avoid is having part of the
functionality accessible in one way (say through FAN_REPORT_DIR_FD) and
having to switch to different way (FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME) for full
functionality. That is in my opinion confusing to users and makes the api
messy in the long term. So I'd lean more towards implementing fid-based
events from the start. I don't think implementation-wise it's going to be
much higher effort than FAN_REPORT_DIR_FD. I agree that for users it is
somewhat more effort - they have to keep the private mount, open fhandle to
get to the dir so that they can fill it in. But that doesn't seem to be
that high bar either?

We even have some precedens that events for regular files support both fd
and fid events and for directory operations only fid events are supported.
We could do it similarly for HSM events...
