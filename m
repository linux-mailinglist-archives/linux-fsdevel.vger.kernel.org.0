This has nothing to do with what "XFS does". It's actually an
IOCB_NOWAIT API design constraint.

That is, IOCB_NOWAIT means "complete the whole operation without
blocking or return -EAGAIN having done nothing".  If we have to do
something that might block (like a timestamp update) then we need to
punt the entire operation before anything has been modified.  This
requires all the "do we need to modify this" checks to be done up
front before we start modifying anything.

So while it looks like this might be "an XFS thing", that's because
XFS tends to be the first filesystem that most io_uring NOWAIT
functionality is implemented on. IOWs, what you see is XFS is doing
things the way IOCB_NOWAIT requires to be done. i.e. it's a
demonstration of how nonblocking filesystem modification operations
need to be run, not an "XFS thing"...

XFS already calls file_accessed() in the DIO read path before the
read gets issued. I don't see any problem with lifting it to before
the copy-out loop in filemap_read() because it is run regardless of
whether any data is read or any error occurred.  Hence it just
doesn't look like it matters if it is run before or after the
copy-out loop to me....
