That is where it belongs, not sure this was ever questioned. And inside
io_rw at that.

It might, if you have IRQ context for the completion. task_work isn't
expensive, however. It's not like a thread offload.

It's definitely worth considering, especially since we can use cflags
like Pavel suggested upfront and not need any extra storage. But it
brings us back to the 32-bit vs 64-bit discussion, and then using blocks
instead of bytes. Which isn't exactly super pretty.
