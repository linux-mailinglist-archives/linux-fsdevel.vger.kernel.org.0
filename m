Where does synchronous access come into play?

No, but they go really well with zonefs.

I don't think this is a good idea.  Zones are a concept for a a very
specific class of zoned devices.  Trying to shoe-horn this into the
byte address files / whole device abstraction not only is ugly
conceptually but also adds the overhead for it to the VFS.

And O_APPEND that returns the written position OTOH makes total sense
at the file level as well and not just for raw zoned devices.
