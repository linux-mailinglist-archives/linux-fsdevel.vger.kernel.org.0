As you mentioned, io_uring_task_cancel() cancels and waits for all
requests submitted by current task, used in exec() and SQPOLL because
of potential races.

io_uring_task_cancel() cancels only selected ones and


io_uring_files_cancel()
cancels and waits only some specific requests that we absolutely have
to, e.g. in 5.15 it'll be only requests referencing the ring itself.
It's used on normal task exit.

io_uring_task_cancel() cancels and waits all requests submitted by
current task, used on exec() because of races.
