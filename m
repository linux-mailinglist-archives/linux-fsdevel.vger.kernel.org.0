Hi Paul,

https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20090608201745.GO8633@ZenIV.linux.org.uk/

After reading this thread, I have doubt about solving this in VFS.
Honestly, however, I'm not sure if it's entirely relevant today.

I think this behavior itself is not specific to bind mounts. Though,
/proc/[pid] files are a bit special since its inode security blob has to be
updated whenever the task's security attribute changed and it requries
revalidation.

I also considered .d_weak_revalidate, but it only helps when the final
component of the path is the mountpoint on path lookup; a task will need to
explicitly access the mountpoint once before accessing the files under the
directory... I don't think it's a solution.


Thanks,
Munehisa
