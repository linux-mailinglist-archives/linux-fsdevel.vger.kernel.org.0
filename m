No, see point 3 and 4 below for why.  We'll need something like the
interface you suggested by me in point 4 and by you in reply to point 3
in the block layer, and then block/fops.c can implement the mapping on
top of that for drivers supporting it.

The flag is just one part of it.  Of course it need to be discoverable
from userspace in one way or another, and the marshalling of the flag
needs to be controller by the file system / fops instance.

Well, that's what I've been arguing for all the time, and what Kanchan's
previous series was working towards.  It's not quite as trivial as
we need a bit more than just the stream, e.g. a way to discover how many
of them exist.
