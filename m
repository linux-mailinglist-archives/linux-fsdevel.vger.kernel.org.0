Greetings to you,

My name is Tam david from Republic of Togo I contacted you last two
weeks and I got no response. I mentioned about my late client that has
the same surname with you. He deposited the sum of ($11.5 million USD)
in one of the bank here in our country and they have asked me to
provide a next of kin.

This money belongs to My Late client who has the same last name with
you and unfortunately he lost his life in motor accident with his
entire family and I wish to present you before the bank as his
relative and next of kin to his estates so that the bank will release
and transfer the inheritance fund into your bank account for our
mutual benefit.

Kindly show your interest to work with me through my personal email
address tamdavid57@gmail.com  to enable me forward the details of this
project to you.

Regards,
Tam david
