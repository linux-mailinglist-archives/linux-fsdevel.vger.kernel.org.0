Thanks for the quick reply, Amir. I'm traveling this week with a hectic
schedule (Usenix FAST++), so I won't get much actual work done.

I'll stipulate that my list-participation skills need improvement, but
I haven't figured out which threads those are. If somebody can point me
directly to them, you will have my gratitude.

Time frame for my initial RFC is probably still a few weeks out.

Same, see above about my questionable list-searching skills

I hope so...

No, but I'll try that when I get back home. I found documentation somewhere
that said ENOSYS was the answer.

I don't know enough to have an opinion here (yet), but I'll start thinking
it through.

Technically it's not that readdirplus can't be helpful for famfs - it's just
that readdirplus is not much help if the response doesn't include famfs
fmaps. 

But I do think the nicest bringup path would be to disable readdirplus, 
so what I should see is a bunch of READDIRs followed by (or alternating 
with?) a bunch of LOOKUPs. That route should aid bringup by avoiding 
new variable payloads on existing commands in the immediate term.

But if said payloads are being designed or considered, I should definitely
get the famfs requirements into that discussion, so we can do something that
works for all of us!
