dear,

I got your contact through the internet due to serious searching for a
reliable personality.  I am Jenneh Kandeh from FreeTown Capital of
Sierra Leone.

Time of opposed to the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kebbah the
ex-leader since 21st November 2005 But I am current residing in
Porto-Novo Benin due to war of my country, my mother killed on
04/01/2002 for Sierra Leone civilian war my father decided to change
another residence country with me because I am only child for my
family bad news that my father passed away on 25/11/2018. During the
war, My father made a lot of money through the illegal sales of
Diamonds. To the tune of $10,200,000.

This money is currently and secretly kept in ECOWAS security company
here in Benin, but because of the political turmoil which still exists
here in Africa, I can not invest the money by myself, hence am
soliciting your help to help me take these funds into your custody and
also advise me on how to invest it.

I want to add here that if agreed 35% of the total worth of the fund
will be yours minus your total expenses incurred during the clearing
of the fund in
Porto Novo Benin that 35% I would like to invest on heavy duty
agricultural equipment and earth moving machines to enable me go into
a full scale mechanized farming. l wait to hear from you
