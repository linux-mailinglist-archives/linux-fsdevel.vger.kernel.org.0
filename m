What if you actually /can/ reuse a nodeid after a restart?  Consider
fuse4fs, where the nodeid is the on-disk inode number.  After a restart,
you can reconnect the fuse_inode to the ondisk inode, assuming recovery
didn't delete it, obviously.

I suppose you could just ask for refreshed stat information and either
the server gives it to you and the fuse_inode lives; or the server
returns ENOENT and then we mark it bad.  But I'd have to see code
patches to form a real opinion.

It's very nice of fuse to have implemented revoke() ;)
