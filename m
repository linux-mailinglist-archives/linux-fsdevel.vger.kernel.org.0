Thanks for the reference Amir! I even had been in that thread.

Definitely, if we agree on the approach on LOOKUP_HANDLE and using it
for recovery, adding that op seems simple. And reading through the
thread you had posted above, just the implementation was missing.
So let's go ahead to do this approach.
