This is exactly where the existing splice API is problematic.  You
can't splice from a file to a network socket right now.  First you
splice to a pipe, and now that pipe contains some magical stuff.  And
it stays there potentially forever.  Then you splice it again to a
socket.

Would this be better if user code could splice straight to a socket?
At least in principle, there could be a _limited_ amount of time
during which anything needs to wait, and it's fundamentally entirely
reasonable if a concurrent write to a file affects data being
zero-copied to a socket _during the time after the zero-copy send is
requested and before it reports completion_.

Frankly, I really don't like having non-immutable data in a pipe.  A
pipe is supposed to be a thing into which bytes are written and out
from which the *same* bytes emerge, at least to the extent that anyone
can observe it.  Do we really want:

$ some_program | tee file21 > file2

to potentially write different data to file1 and file2?
