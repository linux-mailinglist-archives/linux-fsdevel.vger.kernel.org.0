You raise a completely fair point, and I truly do apologies for the
lack of context and in depth explanations around the specific
situations that the proposed BPF kfuncs are intended to be used
from. Admittedly, that's a failure on my part, and I can completely
understand why from a maintainers point of view there would be
reservations around acknowledging requests for adding such invisible
dependencies.

Now, I'm in a little bit of a tough situation as I'm unable to point
you to an open-source BPF LSM implementation that intends to make use
of such newly proposed BPF kfuncs. That's just an unfortunate
constraint and circumstance that I'm having to deal with, so I'm just
going to have to provide heavily redacted and incomplete example to
illustrate how these BPF kfuncs intend to be used from BPF LSM
programs that I personally work on here at Google. Notably though, the
contexts that I do share here may obviously be a nonholistic view on
how these newly introduced BPF kfuncs end up getting used in practice
by some other completely arbitrary open-source BPF LSM programs.

Anyway, as Alexei had pointed out in one of the prior responses, the
core motivating factor behind introducing these newly proposed BPF
kfuncs purely stems from the requirement of needing to call
bpf_d_path() safely on a struct path from the context of a BPF LSM
program, specifically within the security_file_open() and
security_mmap_file() LSM hooks. Now, as noted within the original bug
report [0], it's currently not considered safe to pluck a struct path
out from an arbitrary in-kernel data structure, which in our case was
current->mm->exe_file->f_path, and have it passed to bpf_d_path() from
the aforementioned LSM hook points, or any other LSM hook point for
that matter.

So, without using these newly introduced BPF kfuncs, our BPF LSM
program hanging off security_file_open() looks as follows:

```
int BPF_PROG(file_open, struct file *file)
{
  // Perform a whole bunch of operations on the supplied file argument. This
  // includes some form of policy evaluation, and if there's a violation against
  // policy and auditing is enabled, then we eventually call bpf_d_path() on
  // file->f_path. Calling bpf_d_path() on the file argument isn't problematic
  // as we have a stable path here as the file argument is reference counted.
  struct path *target = &file->f_path;

  // ...

  struct task_struct *current = bpf_get_current_task_btf();

  // ...
  
  bpf_rcu_read_lock();
  // Reserve a slot on the BPF ring buffer such that the actor's path can be
  // passed back to userspace.
  void *buf = bpf_ringbuf_reserve(&ringbuf, PATH_MAX, 0);
  if (!buf) {
    goto unlock;
  }

  // For contextual purposes when performing an audit we also call bpf_d_path()
  // on the actor, being current->mm->exe_file->f_path.
  struct path *actor = &current->mm->exe_file->f_path;

  // Now perform the path resolution on the actor via bpf_d_path().
  u64 ret = bpf_d_path(actor, buf, PATH_MAX);
  if (ret > 0) {
    bpf_ringbuf_submit(buf, BPF_RB_NO_WAKEUP);
  } else {
    bpf_ringbuf_discard(buf, 0);
  }

unlock:
  bpf_rcu_read_unlock();
  return 0;
}
```

Post landing these BPF kfuncs, the BPF LSM program hanging off
security_file_open() would be updated to make use of the
acquire/release BPF kfuncs as below. Here I'm only making use of
bpf_get_task_exe_file(), but similar usage also extends to
bpf_get_task_fs_root() and bpf_get_task_fs_pwd().

```
int BPF_PROG(file_open, struct file *file)
{
  // Perform a whole bunch of operations on the supplied file argument. This
  // includes some form of policy evaluation, and if there's a violation against
  // policy and auditing is enabled, then we eventually call bpf_path_d_path()
  // on file->f_path. Calling bpf_path_d_path() on the file argument isn't
  // problematic as we have a stable path here as the file argument is trusted
  // and reference counted.
  struct path *target = &file->f_path;

  // ...

  struct task_struct *current = bpf_get_current_task_btf();

  // ...
  
  // Reserve a slot on the BPF ring buffer such that the actor's path can be
  // passed back to userspace.
  void *buf = bpf_ringbuf_reserve(&ringbuf, PATH_MAX, 0);
  if (!buf) {
    return 0;
  }

  // For contextual purposes when performing an audit we also call
  // bpf_path_d_path() on the actor, being current->mm->exe_file->f_path.
  // Here we're operating on a stable trused and reference counted file,
  // thanks to bpf_get_task_exe_file().
  struct file *exe_file = bpf_get_task_exe_file(current);
  if (!exe_file) {
    bpf_ringbuf_discard(buf, 0);
    return 0;
  }

  // Now perform the path resolution on the actor via bpf_path_d_path(), which
  // only accepts a trusted struct path.
  u64 ret = bpf_path_d_path(&exe_file->f_path, buf, PATH_MAX);
  if (ret > 0) {
    bpf_ringbuf_submit(buf, BPF_RB_NO_WAKEUP);
  } else {
    bpf_ringbuf_discard(buf, 0);
  }

  // Drop the reference on exe_file.
  bpf_put_file(exe_file);
  return 0;
}
```

This is rather incredibly straightforward, but the fundamental
difference between the two implementations is that one allows us to
work on stable file, whereas the other does not. That's really
it. Similarly, we do more or less the same for our BPF LSM program
that hangs off security_mmap_file().

Do you need anything else which illustrates the proposed BPF kfunc
usage?
