It is important to know that read-only attribute is not a permission
(like UNIX mode or POSIX ACL or Windows ACL) and neither it is not a
security mechanism. It is just an attribute which affects execution of
modification operations.

This this option, there are lot of open questions regarding the
behavior. For example:

How the change mode or change ACL operation executed on Linux should
behave? Should it always clear or set read-only attribute when calling
chmod or setfacl? And what if the user does not have capability or
permission to change mode? Then the user would not be able to clear
read-only attribute (IIRC this attribute can be set/clear by having
just write permission).

And when reading, to which mode / ACL part should be read-only attribute
propagated? Only to user, to all 3 parts (user, group, others), or also
into all ACL entries? For example SMB protocol has extension support for
POSIX ACL, so how it should be handled?

Also how to handle unlink operation? With this option, the user first
would have to call chmod +w and after that would be able to call rm -f.
It it quite non-Linux way that it is needed to have write permission on
the file itself for deleting it. Normally it is needed just write
permission on the parent directory.

I do not have answers for these questions, it seems to be really messy
and not intuitive behavior.

(Windows) read-only attribute is not a permission, it is an attribute,
that is probably confusing. Similarly FS_IMMUTABLE_FL is not a
permission if I understand it correctly.

And about attributes, Now I have tested that on Linux it is possible to
change time attributes (utimensat) also for files which are not owned by
calling user/process, it is just enough for caller to have write
permission.

Read-only is similar to those time attributes.

It differs for unlink operations. Immutable does not allow to to remove
the file. File without write permission can be removed.

I see benefit in FS_IMMUTABLE_FL for that purpose of backup file, but
FS_IMMUTABLE_FL cannot be used by normal user.

Ok, fair enough.

As there are more filesystems which supports this read-only attribute
feature, it make sense to have same API for all of them. So what is the
better option for exporting it to userspace. Via ioctl or via new xattr?
Or is there any other option?
