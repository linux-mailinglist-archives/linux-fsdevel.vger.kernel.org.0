Well said.

More than that, I think this is a situation where we really need to
consider what our priorities are.

Where are most of our real world vulnerabilities coming from? Are they
spectre issues, or are they memory safety issues, and the kinds of
logic/resource issues we know Rust's type system is going to help with?
I think we all know the answer to that question.

More than that, as kernel programmers, we need to be focusing primarily
on the issues that are our responsibility and under our control. At the
point when the inability of the CPU manufacturers to get their shit
together is causing us to have concerns over _generated code for little
helper functions_, the world has gone crazy.

I remember when the spectre stuff first hit, and everyone was saying
"this is just a temporary workaround; CPU manufacturers are going to
sort this out in a couple releases".

They haven't. That's batshit. And I doubt they ever will if we keep
pretending we can just work around everything in software.
