Before answering I want to know: is it easy to remove deprecated option
from code? I read different opinions in this thread.

If removal will be easy, then I vote for deprecated option.
Supporting familiar mount options will help in transition.
After some time (one or two kernel releases?) this support can be dropped.

If removal will be hard, then better to remove now.
It will make things a bit harder for user, but it's better, than
having a list of deprecated options, that do nothing and will be there forever.
