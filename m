Do you absolutely need that superblock to exist? It would probably be
better if you extended struct fs_context to carry the hsm information
and then you later attach it to the superblock once it's created.

Yeah. I don't consider that in itself a dealbreaker though. The messier
part is that the proposal above requires that the superblock exists
before you can set up fanotify. If you register an HSM during mount then
you should set everything as regular mount options before superblock
creation. If the superblock is created the HSM should go into effect
implicitly instead of requiring another fanotify call, imho.

But you could also do it the other way around:

fanotify_something_something(fan_fd, fs_context_fd, ...)
{
        fdget(fs_context_fd);
        if (f.file->f_op != &fscontext_fops)
                return -EINVAL;

        ret = mutex_lock_interruptible(&fc->uapi_mutex);
        if (ret == 0) {
                if (fc->phase != FS_CONTEXT_CREATE_PARAMS &&
                    fc->phase != FS_CONTEXT_RECONF_PARAMS)
                        return -EBUSY;

                /* do your thing */

                mutex_unlock(&fc->uapi_mutex);
        }
}

then you don't need to even use the mount api system calls and can go
through the regular fanotify system calls. You'd just need a sensible
helper that is exposed internally to fanotify to register events during
fscontext creation.

I'm not sure what would be better.

Go look at what bpffs did for their delegation support... Exactly that iirc. :)
