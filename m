I don't think supplying a return value for close() is as helpful as it
seems -- the manage says that there is no guarantee that data has been
flushed to disk; and if the file is removed from the process' fd table
then the operation succeeded no matter the return value. :P

(Also C programmers tend to be sloppy and not check the return value.)

Yes.  I think it's only useful for the case outined in that patch, which
is that a program started an asyncio operation and then closed the fd.
In that particular case the program unambiguously doesn't care about the
return value of close so it's ok to perform the release asynchronously.

Hrm.  I suppose if you had a script that ran two programs one after the
other, each of which expected to be able to open and lock the same file,
then you could run into problems if the lock isn't released by the time
the second program is ready to open the file.

But having said that, some other program could very well open and lock
the file as soon as the lock drops.

I think it only has to be asynchronous for the weird case outlined in
that patch (fuse server gets stuck closing its own client's fds).
Personally I think release ought to be synchronous at least as far as
the kernel doing all the stuff that close() says it has to do (removal
of record locks, deleting the fd table entry).

Note that doesn't necessarily mean that the kernel has to be completely
done with all the work that entails.  XFS defers freeing of unlinked
files until a background garbage collector gets around to doing that.
Other filesystems will actually make you wait while they free all the
data blocks and the inode.  But the kernel has no idea what the fuse
server actually does.

Hum.  Did I not understand the code correctly?  I thought that
flush_bg_queue puts all the background requests onto the active queue
and issues them to the fuse server; and the wait_event_timeout sits
around waiting for all the requests to receive their replies?

I could be mistaken though.  This is my rough understanding of what
happens to background requests:

1. Request created
2. Put request on bg_queue
3. <wait>
4. Request removed from bg_queue
5. Request sent
6. <wait>
7. Reply received
8. Request ends and is _put.

Non-background (foreground?) requests skip steps 2-4.  Meanwhile,
fc->waiting tracks the number of requests that are anywhere between the
end of step 1 and the start of step 8.

In any case, I want to push all the bg requests and wait until there are
no more requests in the system.
