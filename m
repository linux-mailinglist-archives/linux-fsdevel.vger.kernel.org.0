If you're in ->poll() you're holding the epoll mutex and
eventpoll_release_file() needs to acquire ep->mtx as well. So if you're
in ->poll() then you know that eventpoll_release_file() can't progress
and therefore eventpoll_release() can't make progress. So
f_op->release() won't be able to be called as it happens after
eventpoll_release() in __fput(). But f_count being able to go to zero is
expected.
