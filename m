Agreed.  The coredump to a pipe will still be short.  That needs
something additional.

The problem Olivier Langlois <olivier@trillion01.com> reported was
core dumps coming up short because TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL was being
set during a core dump.

We can see this with pipe_write returning -ERESTARTSYS
on a full pipe if signal_pending which includes TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL
is true.

Looking further if the thread that is core dumping initiated
any io_uring work then io_ring_exit_work will use task_work_add
to request that thread clean up it's io_uring state.

Perhaps we can put a big comment in dump_emit and if we
get back -ERESTARTSYS run tracework_notify_signal.  I am not
seeing any locks held at that point in the coredump, so it
should be safe.  The coredump is run inside of file_start_write
which is the only potential complication.



The code flow is complicated but it looks like the entire
point of the exercise is to call io_uring_del_task_file
on the originating thread.  I suppose that keeps the
locking of the xarray in io_uring_task simple.


Hmm.   All of this comes from io_uring_release.
How do we get to io_uring_release?  The coredump should
be catching everything in exit_mm before exit_files?

Confused and hopeful someone can explain to me what is going on,
and perhaps simplify it.

Eric
