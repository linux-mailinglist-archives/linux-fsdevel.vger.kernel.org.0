Yep. Note again that I happen to be using the same repo that I was
bisecting, so technically the test case of recompiling the kernel module
is targeting different code each time, but the failure was so consistent
that I believe it to be a runtime issue.

I don't recall seeing that specific error, but TBH this kind of looks in
line with what I'm seeing in general. My suspicion is that this is not
actually a source code error, but something is corrupted somehow or
another via virtiofs.

As a quick additional test, I just built my same repo from my host
system (running a distro v6.14 kernel) without any issue. Then if I do
the kernel module rebuild test of the same exact repo over virtiofs from
the guest, the error occurs.

What is interesting is that if I try the same thing with another module
(i.e. fs/fuse, fs/nfs), the build seems to work fine, so maybe there is
something unique to XFS going on here. As a followup to that, I set my
repo back to v6.15 but still reproduce the same phenomenon: build
failure when compiling over virtiofs and not from the host.. :/

Apologies I haven't really had a chance to look at the code.. It's
certainly possible I botched something in the bisect or misunderstood
some tooling differences or whatever, but I'm pretty sure I at least
tried the target commit and the immediate preceding commit after the
bisect to double check where the failing starts to happen.

That said, I suspect you are actually reproducing the same general
problem with your test above, regardless of whether the analysis is
wrong. If you're able, have you tried whether that same compile works
from a host (or non-virtiofs) env? Thanks.
