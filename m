There are two concerns here:

1) We need more space than the 48 bytes, which means we need to allocate
   the command or part of the command when get the sqe, and of course
   free that when the command is done.

2) When io_uring_enter() returns and has consumed N commands, the state
   for those commands must be stable. Hence if you're passing in a
   pointer to a struct, that struct will have been read and store
   safely. This prevents things like on-stack structures from being an
   issue.

->async_data deals with #2 here, it's used when a command needs to store
data because we're switching to an async context to execute the command
(or the command is otherwise deferred, eg links and such). You can
always rely on the context being sane, it's either the task itself or
equivalent.

The simple solution is to just keep the command type the same on the
NVMe side, and just pass in a pointer to it. Then API could then be
nr_commands and **commands, for example.

But I think we're getting to the point where it'd be easier to just
discuss actual code. So if you rebase on top of the v3 code, then send
out those patches and we can discuss the most convenient API to present
for nvme passthrough and friends. Does that work?
