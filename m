I haven't looked into the truncate routine yet.  I will see it later.

# DIRECT read
fuse_file_read_iter
  fuse_cache_read_iter
    generic_file_read_iter
      kiocb_write_and_wait
       filemap_write_and_wait_range
      a_ops->direct_IO(),i.e. fuse_direct_IO()

# DIRECT read
fuse_file_write_iter
  fuse_cache_write_iter
    generic_file_write_iter
      generic_file_direct_write
        kiocb_invalidate_pages

IMO overall fi->writectr / fi->queued-writes are introduced to prevent
DIRECT IO and writeback from sending duplicate (inflight) WRITE requests
for the same page.

For the DIRECT write routine:

# non-FOPEN_DIRECT_IO DIRECT write
fuse_cache_write_iter
  fuse_direct_IO
    fuse_direct_io
      fuse_sync_writes


# FOPEN_DIRECT_IO DIRECT write
fuse_direct_write_iter
  fuse_direct_IO
    fuse_direct_io
      fuse_sync_writes


For the writeback routine:
fuse_writepages()
  fuse_writepages_fill
    fuse_writepages_send
      # buffer the WRITE request in queued_writes list
      fuse_flush_writepages
	# flush WRITE only when fi->writectr >= 0

filp_close()

       filp->f_op->flush()
           fuse_flush()
 	     write_inode_now
		writeback_single_inode(WB_SYNC_ALL)
