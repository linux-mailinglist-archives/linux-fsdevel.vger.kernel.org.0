There's multiple issues here.

The main objection in [1] was to allow specifying an arbitrary offset
from userspace. What [3] did was to implement a pread() variant for
directories, i.e., pgetdents(). That can't work in principle/is
prohibitively complex. Which is what your series avoids by not allowing
any offsets to be specified.

However, there's still a problem here. Updates to f_pos happen under an
approriate lock to guarantee consistency of the position between calls
that move the cursor position. In the normal read-write path io_uring
doesn't concern itself with f_pos as it keeps local state in
kiocb->ki_pos.

But then it still does end up running into f_pos consistency problems
for read-write because it does allow operating on the current f_pos if
the offset if struct io_rw is set to -1.

In that case it does retrieve and update f_pos which should take
f_pos_lock and a patchset for this was posted but it didn't go anywhere.
It should probably hold that lock. See Jann's comments in the other
thread how that currently can lead to issues.

For getdents() not protecting f_pos is equally bad or worse. The patch
doesn't hold f_pos_lock and just updates f_pos prior _and_ post
iterate_dir() arguing that this race is fine. But again, f_version and
f_pos are consistent after each system call invocation.

But without that you can have a concurrent seek running and can end up
with an inconsistent f_pos position within the same system call. IOW,
you're breaking f_pos being in a well-known state. And you're not doing
that just for io_uring you're doing it for the regular system call
interface as well as both can be used on the same fd simultaneously.
So that's a no go imho.

The difference is that in both cases f_pos_lock for both getdents and
lseek is held. So f_pos is in a good known state. You're not taking any
locks so now we're risking inconsistency within the same system call if
getdents and lseek run concurrently. Jens also mentioned that you could
even have this problem from within io_uring itself.

So tl;dr, there's no good reason to declare this an acceptable race
afaict. So either this is fixed properly or we're not doing it as far as
I'm concerned.
