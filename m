There is no a problem, this looks rather simple. Two cases are possible:

1)a container has dedicated namespaces set, and CRIU just has to iterate
  files in /proc/namespaces of root pid namespace of the container.
  The relationships between parents and childs of pid and user namespaces
  are founded via ioctl(NS_GET_PARENT).
  
2)container has no dedicated namespaces set. Then CRIU just has to iterate
  all host namespaces. There is no another way to do that, because container
  may have any host namespaces, and hierarchy in /proc/namespaces won't
  help you.

Here are already NS_GET_PARENT and NS_GET_USERNS. What is the problem to use
this interfaces?

This is just the thing I say. This allows to avoid writing recursive dump.
But this has nothing about advantages of hierarchy in /proc/namespaces.

Previous message I wrote about .rename of proc files, Alexey Dobriyan
said this is not a taboo. Are there problem which doesn't cover the case
you point?

Unique names inside one user namespace won't introduce a new /proc
mount. You can't pass a sub-directory of /proc/namespaces/ to a specific
container. To give a virtualized name you have to have a dedicated pid ns.

Let we have in one /proc mount:

/mnt1/proc/namespaces/userns1/.../[namespaceX_name1 -- inode XXX]

In another another /proc mount we have:

/mnt2/proc/namespaces/userns1/.../[namespaceX_name1_synonym -- inode XXX]

The virtualization is made per /proc (i.e., per pid ns). Container should
receive either /mnt1/proc or /mnt2/proc on restore as it's /proc.

There is no a sense of directory hierarchy for virtualization, since
you can't use specific sub-directory as a root directory of /proc/namespaces
to a container. You still have to introduce a new pid ns to have virtualized
/proc.

It's rather subjectively I think. /proc is related to pid ns, and user ns
hierarchy does not look more natural for me.
