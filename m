But we have working code already (merged) in the networking layer for
reusing pages that are mapped to particular devices.

Let's suppose you have a RAID 5 of NVMe devices.  One fails and now
the RAID-5 is operating in degraded mode.  So you hot-unplug the failed
device, plug in a new NVMe drive and add it to the RAID.  The pages now
need to be DMA mapped to that new PCI device.

What I'm saying is that the set of devices that the pages need to be
mapped to is not static and cannot be known at "setup time", even given
the additional information that you were proposing earlier in this thread.
It has to be dynamically adjusted.
