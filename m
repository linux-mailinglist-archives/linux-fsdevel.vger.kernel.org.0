OK.

Thinking of further, if we use ublk for liburing test purpose, root is
often needed, even though we support un-privileged mode, which needs
administrator to grant access, so is it still good to do so?

It could be easier to add ->splice_read() on /dev/zero for test
purpose, just allocate zeroed pages in ->splice_read(), and add
them to pipe like ublk->splice_read(), and sink side can read
from or write to these pages, but zero's read_iter_zero() won't
be affected. And normal splice/tee won't connect to zero too
because we only allow it from kernel use.

->splice_flags shares memory with rwflags, so can't be used.

I think it is fine to use ->addr3, given io_getxattr()/io_setxattr()/
io_msg_ring() has used that.

Got it.
