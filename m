I thought of another twist -- what about a fuse server that runs with no
special privilege and is passed an open fd to a dax/block device?  Maybe
you're right that we need no explicit capability checks -- an open fd is
sufficient.

Oh but the ability to transmogrify is the key benefit of store and
forward!  Suppose you have to jack into some Klingon battle cruiser...
