Correction: I misremembered that umount_tree() is called with
UMOUNT_SYNC only in the case that umount() isn't called with MNT_DETACH.
I mentioned this yesterday in the thread but just in case you missed it
I want to spell it out in detail as well.

This is relevant because UMOUNT_SYNC will raise MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT on all
mounts it unmounts. And that ends up being checked in legitimize_mnt()
to ensure that legitimize_mnt() doesn't call mntput() during path lookup
and risking EBUSY for a umount(..., 0) + mount() sequence for the same
filesystem.

But for umount(.., MNT_DETACH) UMOUNT_SYNC isn't passed and so
MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT isn't raised on the mount and so legitimize_mnt() may
end up doing the last mntput() and cleaning up the filesystem.

In other words, a umount(..., MNT_DETACH) caller needs to be prepared to
deal with EBUSY for a umount(..., MNT_DETACH) + mount() sequence.

So I think we can certainly try this as long as we make it via
queue_rcu_work() to handle the other mntput_no_expire() grace period
dependency we discussed upthread.

Thanks for making take a closer look.
