When I originally implemented it, I had it use
io_region_allocate_pages() but this fails because it's allocating way
too much memory at once. For fuse's use case, each buffer is usually
at least 1 MB if not more. Allocating the memory one buffer a time in
io_region_allocate_pages_multi_buf() bypasses the allocation errors I
was seeing. That's the main reason I don't think this can just use
io_create_region().

Oh okay, from your first message I (and I think christoph too) thought
what you were saying is that the user should be responsible for
allocating the buffers with complete ownership over them, and then
just pass those allocated to the kernel to use. But what you're saying
is that just use a different way for getting the kernel to allocate
the buffers (eg through the IORING_REGISTER_MEM_REGION interface). Am
I reading this correctly?

imo, it looked cleaner as a separate api because it has different
expectations and behaviors and squashing kmbuf into the pbuf api makes
the pbuf api needlessly more complex. Though I guess from the
userspace pov, liburing could have a wrapper that takes care of
setting up the pbuf details for kernel-managed pbufs. But in my head,
having pbufs vs. kmbufs makes it clearer what each one does vs regular
pbufs vs. pbufs that are kernel-managed.

Especially with now having kmbufs go through the ioring mem region
interface, it makes things more confusing imo if they're combined, eg
pbufs that are kernel-managed are created empty and then populated
from the kernel side by whatever subsystem is using them. Right now
there's only one mem region supported per ring, but in the future if
there's the possibility that multiple mem regions can be registered
(eg if userspace doesn't know upfront what mem region length they'll
need), then we should also probably add in a region id param for the
registration arg, which if kmbuf rings go through the pbuf ring
registration api, is not possible to do.

But I'm happy to combine the interfaces and go with your suggestion.
I'll make this change for v2 unless someone else objects.

Yeah, you're right I misremembered and the objections / patch I
dropped was pinning the registered buffer table, not the pbuf ring

Hmm, I'm not sure this idea would work for sparse buffers populated by
the kernel, unless those are automatically pinned too but then from
the user POV for unregistration they'd need to unregister buffers
individually instead of just calling IORING_UNREGISTER_BUFFERS but it
might be annoying for them to now need to know which buffers are
pinned vs not. When i benchmarked the fuse code with vs without pinned
registered buffers, it didn't seem to make much of a difference
performance-wise thankfully, so I just dropped it.

To clarify, is this in reply to why the individual buffers shouldn't
be allocated separately by the kernel?
I added a comment about this above in the discussion about
io_region_allocate_pages_multi_buf(), and if the memory allocation
issue I was seeing is bypassable and the region can be allocated all
at once, I'm happy to make that change. With having the allocation be
separate buffers though, I'm not sure I agree that there are extra
mmaps / userspace management. All the pages across the buffers are
vmapped together and the userspace just needs to do 1 mmap call for
them. On the userspace side, I don't think there's more management
since the mmapped address represents the range across all the buffers.
I'm not seeing how there's wasted space either since the only
requirement is that the buffer size is page aligned. I think also
there's a higher chance of the entire buffer region being physically
contiguous if each buffer is allocated separately vs. all the buffers
are allocated as 1 region. I don't feel strongly about this either way
and I'm happy to allocate the entire region at once if that's
possible.

Just out of curiosity, could you elaborate on the over-accounting and
extra memory footprint? I was under the impression it would be the
same since the accounting gets adjusted by the total bytes allocated?
For the extra memory footprint, is the extra footprint from the
metadata to describe each buffer region, or are you referring to
something else?

Thanks for your input on the series. To iterate / sum up, these are
changes for v2 I'll be making:
- api-wise from userspace/liburing: get rid of KMBUF_RING api
interface and have users go through PBUF_RING api instead with a flag
indicating the ring is kernel-managed
- have kernel buffer allocation go through IORING_REGISTER_MEM_REGION
instead, which means when the pbuf ring is created and the
kernel-managed flag is set, the ring will be empty. The memory region
will need to be registered before the mmap call to the ring fd.
- add apis for subsystems to populate a kernel-managed buffer ring
with addresses from the registered mem region

Does this align with your understanding of the conversation as well or
is there anything I'm missing?

And Christoph, do these changes for v2 work for your use case as well?

Thanks,
Joanne
