Yes. Amir beat me with the response so let me just add that FS_UMOUNT event
is for inotify which guarantees that either you get an event about somebody
unlinking the inode (e.g. IN_DELETE_SELF) or event about filesystem being
unmounted (IN_UMOUNT) if you place mark on some inode. I also don't see how
we would maintain this behavior with what Linus proposes.

So fsnotify needs a list of inodes for the superblock which have marks
attached and for which we hold inode reference. We can keep it inside
fsnotify code although it would practically mean another list_head for the
inode for this list (probably in our fsnotify_connector structure which
connects list of notification marks to the inode). If we actually get rid
of i_sb_list in struct inode, this will be a win for the overall system,
otherwise it is a net loss IMHO. So if we can figure out how to change
other s_inodes owners we can certainly do this fsnotify change.

Yeah, I'm not sure how to get rid of the s_inodes use in quota code. One of
the things we need s_inodes list for is during quotaoff on a mounted
filesystem when we need to iterate all inodes which are referencing quota
structures and free them.  In theory we could keep a list of inodes
referencing quota structures but that would require adding list_head to
inode structure for filesystems that support quotas. Now for the sake of
full context I'll also say that enabling / disabling quotas on a mounted
filesystem is a legacy feature because it is quite easy that quota
accounting goes wrong with it. So ext4 and f2fs support for quite a few
years a mode where quota tracking is enabled on mount and disabled on
unmount (if appropriate fs feature is enabled) and you can only enable /
disable enforcement of quota limits during runtime.  So I could see us
deprecating this functionality altogether although jfs never adapted to
this new way we do quotas so we'd have to deal with that somehow.  But one
way or another it would take a significant amount of time before we can
completely remove this so it is out of question for this series.

I see one problem with the idea "whoever has a need to iterate inodes needs
to keep track of inodes it needs to iterate through". It is fine
conceptually but with s_inodes list we pay the cost only once and multiple
users benefit. With each subsystem tracking inodes we pay the cost for each
user (both in terms of memory and CPU). So if you don't use any of the
subsystems that need iteration, you win, but if you use two or more of
these subsystems, in particular those which need to track significant
portion of all inodes, you are losing.
