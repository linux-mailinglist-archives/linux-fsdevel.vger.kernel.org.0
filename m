I agree. As I at least tried to show, removing write-protection can make
some exploits easier. I'm all for trying to remove this if it simplifies
things but for sure this shouldn't be part of this patchset and we
should be careful about it.

The removal of a (misguided or only partially functioning) protection
mechanism doesn't introduce but removes a failure point.
And I don't think removal and addition of a failure point usually have
the same consequences. Introducing a new failure point will often mean
userspace quickly detects regressions. Such regressions are pretty
common due to security fixes we introduce. Recent examples include [1].
Right after this was merged the regression was reported.

But when allowing behavior that used to fail like ETXTBSY it can be
difficult for userspace to detect such regressions. The reason for that
is quite often that userspace applications don't tend to do something
that they know upfront will fail. Attackers however might.
