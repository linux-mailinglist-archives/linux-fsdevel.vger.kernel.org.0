I'm wondering why it's not enough to have the native auditing just to happen.

E.g. all (I have checked RECVMSG,SENDMSG,SEND and CONNECT) socket related io_uring opcodes
already go via security_socket_{recvmsg,sendmsg,connect}()

IORING_OP_OPENAT* goes via do_filp_open() which is in common with the open[at[2]]() syscalls
and should also trigger audit_inode() and security_file_open().

So why is there anything special needed for io_uring (now that the native worker threads are used)?

Is there really any io_uring opcode that bypasses the security checks the corresponding native syscall
would do? If so, I think that should just be fixed...

Additional LSM based restrictions could be hooked into the io_check_restriction() path
and setup at io_uring_setup() or early io_uring_register() time.

What do you think?
