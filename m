That's not the way to do it.

static inline bool
retry_estale(const long error, const unsigned int flags)
{
        return unlikely(error == -ESTALE && !(flags & LOOKUP_REVAL));
}

And strip the redundant unlikely in the callers.  Having that markup
in callers makes sense only when different callers have different
odds of positive result, which is very much not the case here.
