Also, I have no objection for syzbot to test SLAB, but then from my experience, you are probably on your own to debug further with those testing failures. Until you are able to figure out the buggy patch or patchset introduced the regression, I am afraid not many people would be able to spend much time on SLAB. The developers are pretty much already half-hearted on it by only fixing SLAB here and there without runtime testing it.

This bug also got reported 2 days later by the kernel test robot
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200623090213.GW5535@shao2-debian/).
Then it was fixed by commit 437edcaafbe3, so telling syzbot:

#syz fix: mm, slab/slub: improve error reporting and overhead of cache_from_obj()-fix

If CONFIG_SLAB is no longer useful and supported then it needs to be removed
from the kernel.  Otherwise, it needs to be tested just like all other options.
