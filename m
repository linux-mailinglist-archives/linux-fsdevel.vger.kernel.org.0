From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

[ Upstream commit 8c2e52ebbe885c7eeaabd3b7ddcdc1246fc400d2 ]

Jann Horn points out that epoll is decrementing the ep refcount and then
doing a

    mutex_unlock(&ep->mtx);

afterwards. That's very wrong, because it can lead to a use-after-free.

That pattern is actually fine for the very last reference, because the
code in question will delay the actual call to "ep_free(ep)" until after
it has unlocked the mutex.

But it's wrong for the much subtler "next to last" case when somebody
*else* may also be dropping their reference and free the ep while we're
still using the mutex.

Note that this is true even if that other user is also using the same ep
mutex: mutexes, unlike spinlocks, can not be used for object ownership,
even if they guarantee mutual exclusion.

A mutex "unlock" operation is not atomic, and as one user is still
accessing the mutex as part of unlocking it, another user can come in
and get the now released mutex and free the data structure while the
first user is still cleaning up.

See our mutex documentation in Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst,
in particular the section [1] about semantics:

	"mutex_unlock() may access the mutex structure even after it has
	 internally released the lock already - so it's not safe for
	 another context to acquire the mutex and assume that the
	 mutex_unlock() context is not using the structure anymore"

So if we drop our ep ref before the mutex unlock, but we weren't the
last one, we may then unlock the mutex, another user comes in, drops
_their_ reference and releases the 'ep' as it now has no users - all
while the mutex_unlock() is still accessing it.

Fix this by simply moving the ep refcount dropping to outside the mutex:
the refcount itself is atomic, and doesn't need mutex protection (that's
the whole _point_ of refcounts: unlike mutexes, they are inherently
about object lifetimes).

LLM Generated explanations, may be completely bogus:

Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my
assessment:

**YES**, this commit should be backported to stable kernel trees.

## Extensive Explanation:

### 1. **Critical Use-After-Free Bug Fix**

This commit fixes a serious use-after-free vulnerability in the epoll
subsystem. The bug occurs because:

- The code was decrementing the refcount while still holding `ep->mtx`
- `mutex_unlock()` is not atomic and can access the mutex structure
  after internally releasing the lock
- If another thread drops the last reference and frees the eventpoll
  structure, the ongoing `mutex_unlock()` will access freed memory

### 2. **Real Security Impact**

From the code changes:
```c
// BEFORE (buggy):
dispose = ep_refcount_dec_and_test(ep);
mutex_unlock(&ep->mtx);  // UAF risk here!
if (dispose)
    ep_free(ep);

// AFTER (fixed):
mutex_unlock(&ep->mtx);
if (ep_refcount_dec_and_test(ep))
    ep_free(ep);
```

This is a classic use-after-free that could be exploited for:
- Privilege escalation
- System crashes/DoS
- Potential arbitrary code execution

### 3. **Race Condition in Common Code Path**

The vulnerable code is in frequently used functions:
- `__ep_remove()` - called when removing epoll items
- `ep_remove_safe()` - wrapper for safe removal
- `ep_clear_and_put()` - called during epoll cleanup
- `eventpoll_release_file()` - called when files are closed

These are not obscure edge cases but core epoll operations that happen
during normal system operation.

### 4. **Affects Systems Using Refcounted epoll**

The refcounting mechanism was introduced in commit 4f04cbaf128 ("epoll:
use refcount to reduce ep_mutex contention") to improve performance. Any
kernel with this commit is vulnerable to the use-after-free bug.

### 5. **Simple and Safe Fix**

The fix is minimal and low-risk:
- Simply reorders operations to move refcount decrement after mutex
  unlock
- No new features or architectural changes
- The refcount is atomic and doesn't need mutex protection
- Follows the documented mutex semantics

### 6. **Matches Stable Criteria**

Per stable kernel rules, this fix:
- ✓ Fixes a real bug (use-after-free)
- ✓ Small and contained change
- ✓ No side effects beyond fixing the issue
- ✓ Critical for system stability/security
- ✓ Already tested (committed by Linus himself)

### 7. **Documentation Reference**

The commit explicitly references kernel documentation about mutex
semantics that explains why this ordering is critical. This shows it's
fixing a well-understood concurrency issue, not experimental behavior.

The simplicity of the fix combined with the severity of the bug (use-
after-free in core kernel code) makes this an ideal candidate for stable
backporting. Systems running kernels with the epoll refcounting feature
need this fix to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and system
crashes.
