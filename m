It was a partial fix only. Oleg Nesterov pointed out that the fix was
not good if if the core dump was written into a pipe.

Yes I have seen your work to fix the problem.

It just seems to me that there is no good reason to keep io_uring
process requests once you are generating a core dump and simply
cancelling io_uring before generating the core dump would have avoided
the problem that you have encountered plus any other similar issues yet
to come...
