This patch series adds support for async buffered writes when using both
xfs and io-uring. Currently io-uring only supports buffered writes in the
slow path, by processing them in the io workers. With this patch series i=
t is
now possible to support buffered writes in the fast path. To be able to u=
se
the fast path the required pages must be in the page cache, the required =
locks
in xfs can be granted immediately and no additional blocks need to be rea=
d
form disk.

Updating the inode can take time. An optimization has been implemented fo=
r
the time update. Time updates will be processed in the slow path. While t=
here
is already a time update in process, other write requests for the same fi=
le,
can skip the update of the modification time.

Performance results:
  For fio the following results have been obtained with a queue depth of
  1 and 4k block size (runtime 600 secs):

                 sequential writes:
                 without patch           with patch      libaio     psync
  iops:              77k                    209k          195K       233K
  bw:               314MB/s                 854MB/s       790MB/s    953M=
B/s
  clat:            9600ns                   120ns         540ns     3000n=
s


For an io depth of 1, the new patch improves throughput by over three tim=
es
(compared to the exiting behavior, where buffered writes are processed by=
 an
io-worker process) and also the latency is considerably reduced. To achie=
ve the
same or better performance with the exisiting code an io depth of 4 is re=
quired.
Increasing the iodepth further does not lead to improvements.

In addition the latency of buffered write operations is reduced considera=
bly.



Support for async buffered writes:

  To support async buffered writes the flag FMODE_BUF_WASYNC is introduce=
d. In
  addition the check in generic_write_checks is modified to allow for asy=
nc
  buffered writes that have this flag set.

  Changes to the iomap page create function to allow the caller to specif=
y
  the gfp flags. Sets the IOMAP_NOWAIT flag in iomap if IOCB_NOWAIT has b=
een set
  and specifies the requested gfp flags.

  Adds the iomap async buffered write support to the xfs iomap layer.
  Adds async buffered write support to the xfs iomap layer.

Support for async buffered write support and inode time modification

  Splits the functions for checking if the file privileges need to be rem=
oved in
  two functions: check function and a function for the removal of file pr=
ivileges.
  The same split is also done for the function to update the file modific=
ation time.

  Implement an optimization that while a file modification time is pendin=
g other
  requests for the same file don't need to wait for the file modification=
 update.=20
  This avoids that a considerable number of buffered async write requests=
 get
  punted.

  Take the ilock in nowait mode if async buffered writes are enabled and =
enable
  the async buffered writes optimization in io_uring.

Support for write throttling of async buffered writes:

  Add a no_wait parameter to the exisiting balance_dirty_pages() function=
. The
  function will return -EAGAIN if the parameter is true and write throttl=
ing is
  required.

  Add a new function called balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_async() that =
will be
  invoked from iomap_write_iter() if an async buffered write is requested=
.
 =20
Enable async buffered write support in xfs
   This enables async buffered writes for xfs.


Testing:
  This patch has been tested with xfstests and fio.


Changes:
  V3:
  - Reformat new code in generic_write_checks_count() to line lengthof 80=
.
  - Remove if condition in __iomap_write_begin to maintain current behavi=
or.
  - use GFP_NOWAIT flag in __iomap_write_begin
  - rename need_file_remove_privs() function to file_needs_remove_privs()
  - rename do_file_remove_privs to __file_remove_privs()
  - add kernel documentation to file_remove_privs() function
  - rework else if branch in file_remove_privs() function
  - add kernel documentation to file_modified() function
  - add kernel documentation to file_modified_async() function
  - rename err variable in file_update_time to ret
  - rename function need_file_update_time() to file_needs_update_time()
  - rename function do_file_update_time() to __file_update_time()
  - don't move check for FMODE_NOCMTIME in generic helper
  - reformat __file_update_time for easier reading
  - add kernel documentation to file_update_time() function
  - fix if in file_update_time from < to <=3D
  - move modification of inode flags from do_file_update_time to file_mod=
ified()
    When this function is called, the caller must hold the inode lock.
  - 3 new patches from Jan to add new no_wait flag to balance_dirty_pages=
(),
    remove patch 12 from previous series
  - Make balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_flags() a static function
  - Add new balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_async() function
 =20
  V2:
  - Remove atomic allocation
  - Use direct write in xfs_buffered_write_iomap_begin()
  - Use xfs_ilock_for_iomap() in xfs_buffered_write_iomap_begin()
  - Remove no_wait check at the end of xfs_buffered_write_iomap_begin() f=
or
    the COW path.
  - Pass xfs_inode pointer to xfs_ilock_iocb and rename function to
    xfs_lock_xfs_inode
  - Replace existing uses of xfs_ilock_iocb with xfs_ilock_xfs_inode
  - Use xfs_ilock_xfs_inode in xfs_file_buffered_write()
  - Callers of xfs_ilock_for_iomap need to initialize lock mode. This is
    required so writes use an exclusive lock
  - Split of _balance_dirty_pages() from balance_dirty_pages() and return
    sleep time
  - Call _balance_dirty_pages() in balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_flags(=
)
  - Move call to balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_flags() in iomap_write_i=
ter()
    to the beginning of the loop
