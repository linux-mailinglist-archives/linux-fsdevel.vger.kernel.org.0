Deriving starting position was not the purpose at all.
But yes, append-offset is not needed, for a different reason.
It was kept for uring specific handling. Completion-result from lower
layer was always coming to uring in ret2 via ki_complete(....,ret2).
And ret2 goes to CQE (and user-space) without any conversion in between.
For polled-completion, there is a short window when we get ret2 but cannot
write into CQE immediately, so thought of storing that in append_offset
(but should not have done, solving was possible without it).

FWIW, if we move to indirect-offset approach, append_offset gets
eliminated automatically, because there is no need to write to CQE
itself.

The address needs to be stored somewhere. And there does not seem
other option but to use io_kiocb?
The bigger problem with address/indirect-offset is to be able to write to it
during completion as process-context is different. Will that require entering
into task_work_add() world, and may make it costly affair?

Using flags have not been liked here, but given the upheaval involved so
far I have begun to feel - it was keeping things simple. Should it be
reconsidered?
