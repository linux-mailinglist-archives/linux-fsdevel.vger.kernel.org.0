There's one fundamental question here that we'll need an official answer to:

Is it ok for an out-of-tree BPF LSM program, that nobody has ever seen
to request access to various helpers in the kernel?

Because fundamentally this is what this patchset is asking to be done.

If the ZFS out-of-tree kernel module were to send us a similar patch
series asking us for a list of 9 functions that they'd like us to export
what would the answer to that be? It would be "no" - on principle alone.

So what is different between an out-of-tree BPF LSM program that no one
even has ever seen and an out-of-tree kernel module that one can at
least look at in Github? Why should we reject requests from the latter
but are supposed to accept requests from the former?

If we say yes to the BPF LSM program requests we would have to say yes
to ZFS as well.
