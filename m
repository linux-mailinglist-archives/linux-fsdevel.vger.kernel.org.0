I agree the duplication is not good.

Well, if we leave handling of ignore marks completely to ->handle_event()
then we pay the cost of indirect call even for ignored events. Not sure how
much will it be visible in the overall costs, it's probably worth
benchmarking and we'll see.

Yeah, I'm not sure if adding another flag that iteracts with ON_CHILD or
ONDIR adds any clarity to this mess. In my opinion defining that ON_CHILD
flag in the ignore mask means "apply this ignore mask to events from
immediate children" has an intuitive meaning as it is exactly matching the
semantics of ON_CHILD in the normal mark mask.

With ONDIR I agree things are not as obvious. Historically we have applied
ignore mask even for events coming from directories regardless of ONDIR
flag in the ignore mask. So ignore mask without any special flag has the
implicit meaning of "apply to all events regardless of type of originating
inode". I don't think we can change that meaning at this point. We could
define meaning of ONDIR in ignore mask to either "ignore only events from
directories" or to "ignore only events from ordinary files". But neither
seems particularly natural or useful.

Another concern is that currently fanotify_mark() ignores both ONDIR and
ON_CHILD flags in the ignore mask. So there is a chance someone happens to
set them by accident. For the ON_CHILD flag I would be willing to take a
chance and assign the meaning to this flag because I think chances for
real world breakage are really low. But for ONDIR, given it is unclear
whether ignore masks should apply for directory events without that flag, I
think the chances someone sets it "just to be sure" are high enough that I
would be reluctant to take that chance. So for ONDIR I think we are more or
less stuck with keeping it unused in the ignore mask.
