I have no idea about the original flame war that ended RichACLs in
additition to having no clear clue what RichACLs are supposed to
achieve. My current knowledge extends to "Christoph didn't like them".

Yes, very likely.

We'd either have to change the current inode operations for getting and
setting acls to take a new struct acl that can contain either posix acls
or rich acls or add new ones just for these new fangled ones.

Choosing the first - more sensible - of these two options will mean
updating each filesystem's acl inode operations. Might turn out to not
be invasive code as it might boil down to struct posix_acl *acl =
acl->posix at the beginning of each method but still.

Then we'd probably also need to:

* handle permission checking (see Jeff's comment below)
* change/update the ACL caching layer
* if the past hast taught me anything then overlayfs would probably need
  some additional logic as well

Jeff, I know you have some knowledge in this area you probably are
better equipped to judge the sanity and feasibility of this.
