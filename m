Eh fair point. As mentioned at the top I'm not that worried about it,
just wanted to entertain discussion on a potentially clean way to do
both (thanks). Sounds more like it's not worth it.

Looking back at the patch again, my only followup comment is for the
handful of cases where the newly added iomap_length() is clearly the
tail of a loop, could we instead add the call to the loop iteration
line? I.e.:

	do {
		...
		iomap_iter_advance();
	while ((length = iomap_length(iter)) > 0)

With that tweak I'm good with it:
