Mateusz is right. That check is mostly nonsensical. Nothing will protect
against mount properties being changed if the caller isn't claiming
write access to the mount. Which this code doesn't do (And can't do (or
anything like it) because it would cause spurious remount failures just
because someone execs something.).

So 0fd338b2d2cd ("exec: move path_noexec() check earlier") introduced
WARN_ON_ONCE(). I suspect that it simply wasn't clear that mount
properties can change while a is file held open if no write access was
claimed.

Stuff like noexec, nodev or whatever can change anytime if e.g., just
read access was requested. In other words, successful permission
checking during path lookup doesn't mean that permission checking
wouldn't fail if one redid the checks immediately after.

I think it probably never triggered because noexec -> exec remounts are
rarely done and the timing would have to be rather precise.

I think the immediate solution is to limit the scope of the
WARN_ON_ONCE() to the ->i_mode check.
