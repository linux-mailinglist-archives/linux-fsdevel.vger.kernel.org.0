Well, the main thing I would've liked is a bit more discussion in the
early days of io_uring; there are things we could've done differently
back then that could've got us something cleaner in the long run.

My main complaints were always
 - yet another special purpose ringbuffer, and
 - yet another parallel syscall interface.

We've got too many of those too (aio is another), and the API
fragmentation is a real problem for userspace that just wants to be able
to issue arbitrary syscalls asynchronously. IO uring could've just been
serializing syscall numbers and arguments - that would have worked fine.

Given the history of failed AIO replacements just wanting to shove in
something working was understandable, but I don't think those would have
been big asks.

Thanks, I wasn't aware of that - that's worth highlighting. I may switch
thread_with_file to that, and the fsconfig work David and I are talking
about can probably use it as well.

We really should have something lighter weight that we can use for work
items though, that's our standard mechanism for deferred work, not
spinning up a whole kthread. We do have kthread_use_mm() - there's no
reason we couldn't do an expanded version of that for all the other
shared resources that need to be available.

This was also another blocker in the other aborted AIO replacements, so
reusing clone flags does seem like the most reasonable way to make
progress here, but I would wager there's other stuff in task_struct that
really should be shared and isn't. task_struct is up to 825 (!) lines
now, which means good luck on even finding that stuff - maybe at some
point we'll have to get a giant effort going to clean up and organize
task_struct, like willy's been doing with struct page.

*nod* that's encouraging. Looking forward to the umount issue being
fixed so I can re-enable it in my tests...
