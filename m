There are two problems with it:

We do not know how code points above U+FFFF could be converted to upper
case. Basically from exfat specification can be deduced it only for
U+0000 .. U+FFFF code points. We asked if we can get answer from MS, but
I have not received any response yet.

Second problem is that all MS filesystems (vfat, ntfs and exfat) do not
use UCS-2 nor UTF-16, but rather some mix between it. Basically any
sequence of 16bit values (except those :/<>... vfat chars) is valid,
even unpaired surrogate half. So surrogate pair (two 16bit values)
represents one unicode code point (as in UTF-16), but one unpaired
surrogate half is also valid and represent (invalid) unicode code point
of its value. In unicode are not defined code points for values of
single / half surrogate.

Therefore if we talk about encoding UTF-16 vs UTF-32 we first need to
fix a way how to handle those non-representative values in VFS encoding
(iocharset=) as UTF-8 is not able to represent it too. One option is to
extend UTF-8 to WTF-8 encoding [1] (yes, this is a real and make sense!)
and then ideally change exfat_toupper() to UTF-32 without restriction
for surrogate pairs values.

Btw, same problem with UTF-16 also in vfat, ntfs and also in iso/joliet
kernel drivers.
