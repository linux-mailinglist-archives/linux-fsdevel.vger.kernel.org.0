NAK.  We are not littering fs/namei.c with incremental broken bits
and pieces with uncertain eventual use.

And it's broken - lookup_slow() is *NOT* the only place that can and
does block.  For starters, ->d_revalidate() can very well block and
it is called outside of lookup_slow().  So does ->d_automount().
So does ->d_manage().

I'm rather sceptical about the usefulness of non-blocking open, to be
honest, but in any case, one thing that is absolutely not going to
happen is piecewise introduction of such stuff without a discussion
of the entire design.
