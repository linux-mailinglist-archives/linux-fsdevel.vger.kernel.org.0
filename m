Thanks. Got a link or anything, for my own curiosity?

Also, I presume the followup fstest is a reproducer?

Yeah.. at first it looked like a bug to me, then I realized the same
thing later. I suspect it might be wise to just clear it entirely to
avoid any future landmines, but that could just be my internal bias
talking too. No big deal either way.

Ahh, I see. I missed the round_ptr_up() adjustments. That makes more
sense now.

IMO it would be a little cleaner to just bail out earlier as such. But
either way, I suppose if you could add a small comment with this
alignment context you've explained above with the error checks then that
is good enough for me. Thanks!
