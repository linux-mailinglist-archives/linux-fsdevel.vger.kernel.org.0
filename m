Point...  With this one it would be along the lines of "the parts of
Christoph's write_one_page() elimination series that missed the previous
merge window".

pull-fd: "routine whack-a-mole for new unwarranted callers of fget() that
really ought to have been using fdget() - that kind of stuff keeps
cropping up and needs to be hunted down once in a while".

pull-old_dio: "For a while fs/direct-io.c had been trying to keep up with
filesystems' demands; eventually the tricky cases started to convert to
iomap-based variant, so some of the stuff added for e.g. btrfs sake had
become unused.  Longer term we want to get rid of fs/direct-io.c completely,
but for now let's at least undo some of the now-useless complexity there"

pull-nios2, pull-misc: really can't improve the descriptions in those...
