And what is the exact size you are asking for here?
What is the dma ops set to for your system?  Are you sure that is
working properly for your platform?  What platform is this exactly?

The driver isn't asking for DMA32 here, so that shouldn't be the issue,
so why do you feel it is?  Have you tried using the tracing stuff for
dma allocations to see exactly what is going on for this failure?

I think you need to do a bit more debugging :)
