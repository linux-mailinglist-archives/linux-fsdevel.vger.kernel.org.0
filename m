This has little to do with the desktop. Startup scheduling is
mostly about figuring out when we can do the next step of startup, and
to a big amount this means issuing a mount command of some form, then
waiting until it is established, then invoking the next and so on, and
when the right mounts are established start the right services that
require them and so on. And with today's system complexity with
storage daemons and so on this all becomes a complex network of
concurrent dependencies.

Most mounts are established on behalf of pid 1 itself, for those we
could just wait until the mount syscall/command completes (and we
do). But there's plenty cases where that's not the case, hence we need
to make sure we follow system mount table state as a whole, regardless
if its systemd itself that triggers some mount or something else (for
example some shell script, udisks, â€¦).

systemd does not propagate mount events to desktops.

You appear to be thinking about the "udisks" project or so?
