Right, and in practice LOCALIO doesn't prevent any expected NFS client
or server shutdown within containers.

Proper refcounting of required resources from host is needed, new
requirement for LOCALIO is that nfsd be properly refcounted until
consuming nfs client code exits.  But if LOCALIO client is connected
to a server, if/when that server shuts down it isn't blocked from
doing so simply because a LOCALIO client is active.

Rather than have general concern for LOCALIO doing something wrong,
we'd do well to make sure there is proper test coverage for required
shutdown sequences (completely indepent of LOCALIO, maybe that already
exists?).  I'm 99.99% sure LOCALIO will pass all of that testing
(informed by manual testing I have done with container shutdown, etc).
