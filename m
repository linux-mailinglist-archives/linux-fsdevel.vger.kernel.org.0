Well at first I was all "Ehhh, why are all the request ids zero??".

Later when I started debugging corruption problems in fuse2fs I realized
that it would be really helpful to be able to match the start and end of
a particular fuse request to all the stuff that happened in between.

*So far* I can mostly just watch the raw ftrace feed to see what's going
on without going crazy, but yes, a wireshark plugin would be nice.  Or
someone writing fuseslow. ;)

That will actually cause some loss of trace data --
trace_fuse_request_end also captures the error code of the aborted
commands, so you can tell from the -103 error code that something really
bad happened.
