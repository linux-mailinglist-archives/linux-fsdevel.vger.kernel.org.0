This looks good to me. Thank you for helping to adapt this patch!

Yeah, unit tests are a much more efficient way to catch problems compared
to full system tests. Running them regularly would be a great way to
quickly surface issues.

On top of that, I think it's worth revisiting our current code and cleaning
up some of the logic. Specifically, refactoring initialization functions to
align with the single-responsibility principle would enable reuse between
production and testing flows, and minimize strange edge cases weâ€™ve been
seeing.
