This is very annoying. And it probably doesn't work for dynamic
binaries. 90% of the code will be in libraries to which one can happily
write. Plus there's various attacks to break this:
https://svs.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/publications/2020/2020-08-27-Bohling-IMA.pdf

Anyway, I really really don't want to add more complex
deny_write_access() either. It's hard to understand, it's hard to
document and it punches holes into this anyway. The freezing levels are
annoying enough already.

So then I propose we just make the deny write stuff during exec
conditional on IMA being active. At the end it's small- vs chicken pox.

(I figure it won't be enough for IMA to read the executable after it has
been mapped MS_PRIVATE?)
