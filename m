Right, this is kind of nasty.

Yes, essentially you must make sure you will not read any new events from
the notification queue between fd close & writing of the response. Frankly,
I find this as quite ugly and asking for trouble (subtle bugs down the
line).

I agree that having 64-bit id in an event and just increment it with each
event would be simple and fine way to identify events. This could then be
used to match responses to events when we would be reporting permission
events for FID groups as I outlined in my email yesterday [1].

How do you want to use it for persistent change journal? I'm mostly asking
because currently I expect the number to start from 0 for each fsnotify
group created but if you'd like to persist somewhere the event id, this
would not be ideal?

I was thinking about this as well and as you say, technically there is no
problem with this - just bypass writer the checks when opening the file -
but I think it just gives userspace too much rope to hang itself on. So if
we are going to support something like this it will require very careful
API design and wider consensus among VFS people this is something we are
willing to support.

That's another good point that currently we don't generate fsnotify events
on page faults. For lazy filling of executables this is basically must-have
functionality and I'd say that even for lazy filling of other files,
handling notifications on page faults will come up sooner rather than
later. So this is probably the thing we'll have to handle first.
