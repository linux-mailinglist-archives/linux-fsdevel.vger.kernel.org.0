So this is why PR_IO_FLUSHER is introduced here, which is specifically
for user space components playing a role in IO stack, e.g. fuse daemon,
tcmu/nbd daemon, etc.  PR_IO_FLUSHER offers guarantee similar to
GFP_NOIO, but for user space components.  At least we can rely on the
assumption that mm would take PR_IO_FLUSHER into account.

The limitation of the PR_IO_FLUSHER approach is that, as pointed by
Miklos[1], there may be multiple components or services involved to
service the fuse requests, and the kernel side has no effective way to
check if all services in the whole chain have set PR_IO_FLUSHER.

Nope.  What I mean in the previous email is that, kswapd can get stalled
in direct reclaim, while the normal process, e.g. the fuse server, may
not get stalled in certain condition, e.g. explicitly advertising
PR_IO_FLUSHER.

That is a good idea but I'm afraid it doesn't works.  Explained below.

Yes, the direct reclaim would end up calling ->writepage() to writeback
the dirty page.  ->writepages() is only called in normal writeback
routine, e.g. when triggered from balance_dirty_page().

Also FYI FUSE has removed ->writepage() since commit e1c420a ("fuse:
Remove fuse_writepage"), and now it relies on ->migrate_folio(), i.e.
memory compacting and the normal writeback routine (triggered from
balance_dirty_page()) in low memory.

Thus I'm afraid the approach of doing temp page copying only for
writeback from direct reclaim code actually doesn't work.  That's
because when doing the direct reclaim, the process not only waits for
the writeback completion submitted from direct reclaim (e.g. marked with
PG_reclaim, by ->writepage), but may also waits for that submitted from
the normal writeback routine (without PG_reclaim marked, by
->writepages). See commit c3b94f4 ("memcg: further prevent OOM with too
many dirty pages").
