Put another way, name_to_handle_at(2) currently states:

   Obtaining a persistent filesystem ID
       The mount IDs in /proc/self/mountinfo can be reused as
       filesystems are unmounted and mounted.  Therefore, the mount ID
       returned by name_to_handle_at()  (in  *mount_id)  should  not  be
       treated  as  a persistent identifier for the corresponding
       mounted filesystem.  However, an application can use the
       information in the mountinfo record that corresponds to the mount
       ID to derive a persistent identifier.

       For example, one can use the device name in the fifth field of
       the mountinfo record to search for the corresponding device UUID
       via the symbolic links in /dev/disks/by-uuid.   (A  more
       comfortable  way  of obtaining the UUID is to use the libblkid(3)
       library.)  That process can then be reversed, using the UUID to
       look up the device name, and then obtaining the corre‚Äê sponding
       mount point, in order to produce the mount_fd argument used by
       open_by_handle_at().

Returning the 64bit mount id makes this race-free because we now have
statmount():

u64 mnt_id = 0;
name_to_handle_at(AT_FDCWD, "/path/to/file", &handle, &mnt_id, 0);
statmount(mnt_id);

Which gets you the device number which one can use to figure out the
uuid without ever having to open a single file (We could even expose the
UUID of the filesystem through statmount() if we wanted to.).
