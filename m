Eric, are you fine with doing the cancelation based patch for now? IMHO
it's not the ideal approach, but it will resolve the issue. And it'd
honestly be great to get some closure on this so we don't have truncated
core dumps if they are interrupted by task_work.

The best solution would be to make the core dumps resilient to
task_work, but a workable solution would be nice at this point...
