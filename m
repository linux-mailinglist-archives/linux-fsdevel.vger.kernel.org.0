Yeah, the compiler can make a guess at the likely branch direction,
but it's not magic. Anecdotally, early return paths generally seem to
be inferred to be unlikely and if branches seemed to be inferred as
likely (and else branches therefore as unlikely). That's a good
starting point, but a programmer may well have more context to know
which direction branches are likely to go. Additionally, explicit
likely()/unlikely() annotations seem to encourage compilers to
optimize more aggressively for the likely path (e.g. splitting the
unlikely path into a separate function). I guess compilers want to
hedge their bets if they're relying on heuristics to predict the
branch direction.
The performance benefit of each likely()/unlikely() is generally
small, so I tend to agree adding them is usually a premature
optimization. But it can certainly be helpful to improve the code
generation of a hot path. And it's used widely throughout io_uring due
to the focus on maximizing performance.

And that's the case here; the if condition is only false in the error
case where buffer_group doesn't specify a valid kernel buf ring.

Not sure I agree about this distinction between likely() and
unlikely() in general. For example, it can make sense to annotate an
early return path with likely() to override the compiler's heuristic
that early returns are unlikely.

Yes, this is probably the biggest pitfall of likely()/unlikely(). The
additional macro call also makes the code a bit harder for a human to
parse. Commit 4ec703ec0c38 ("io_uring: fix incorrect unlikely() usage
in io_waitid_prep()") is a good example of both these problems.

It can absolutely make sense to use likely()/unlikely() to annotate
individual components of an && or || expression, not just a full
if/while/for/ternary condition. Since && and || are short-circuiting
operators, the compiler will often emit a branch after each boolean
operand. (For example, absent optimizations, if (a && b) ... is
translated into if (a) { if (b) ... }.)
But you're totally correct that likely(A && B) implies likely(A) &&
likely(B), so there's no need to separately annotate each of the
operands to the &&s here.

Best,
Caleb
