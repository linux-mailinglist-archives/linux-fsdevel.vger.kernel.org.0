Great, I assumed there are stricter requirements for mtime not
transiently failing.

Maybe I didn't fully grasp the (2) idea

2.1: all read_iter, write_iter, etc. callbacks should do file_accessed()
before doing IO, which sounds like a good option if everyone agrees with
that. Taking a look at direct block io, it's already like this.

2.2: Having io_uring doing file_accessed(). Since it's all currently
hidden behind {read,write}_iter() callbacks and not easily extractable,
it doesn't like a good option, unless I missed sth.
E.g. this ugliness comes to mind.

io_uring_read() {
	file_accessed();
	file->f_op->read_iter(DONT_TOUCH_ATIME);
	...
}

read_iter_impl() {
	// some pre processing

	if (!(flags & DONT_TOUCH_ATIME))
		file_accessed();
}
