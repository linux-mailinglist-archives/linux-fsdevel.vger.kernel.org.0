There is no difference for "regular" use cases, only io_uring with
buffered reads will behave differently. So I don't think you have longer
boot times due to this.

You can't see that. It'll always be available on ext4 with this series,
and you can watch io_uring instances to see if anyone is using it.

No to all of these, you don't need anything to activate it. You need the
program to use io_uring to do buffered reads.

No kconfig options are needed.
