That's kinda what worries me - we do see people winding the dirty
thresholds way down to work around various niche problems with
dirty page buildup.

We also have small extra accounting overhead for cases where we've
stacked layers to so the lower layers don't dirty throttle before
the higher layer. If the lower layer throttles first, then the
higher layer can't clean pages and we can deadlock.

Those are the sorts of subtle, niche situations where I worry that
the subtle "throttle first, write second" change could manifest...

Cheers,

Dave.
