Hi Gabriel,

Thanks for the comments. I agree with all the style and typo fixes (sorry about
that stray "ext4" mention, I copied the help message from the ext4 kunit config
option and I didn't notice that).

I don't think it's a good idea to have the version specifier hardcoded twice in
the same file, one in string form (for utf8_load) and another one in integer
form (for the rest of the functions that take the version as a parameter). I
think it'd be a better option to use a macro to stringify the version number
from the integer constants and avoid the snprintf entirely:

#define str(s) #s
#define VERSION_STR(maj, min, rev) str(maj) "." str(min) "." str(rev)

...

table = utf8_load(VERSION_STR(latest_maj, latest_min, latest_rev));


This way we can define the version constant only once, in integer form, and
then the string form will be a constant generated at compile time. Are you ok
with this?

Cheers,
Ricardo
