Well, there's also always the option of having:

struct file_handle {
	unsigned int handle_bytes_flags;
	int handle_type;
	unsigned char f_handle[];
};

And then helper functions like:

unsigned int file_handle_bytes(struct file_handle *handle)
{
	return handle->handle_bytes_flags & 0xffff;
}

unsigned int file_handle_flags(struct file_handle *handle)
{
	return handle->handle_bytes_flags >> 16;
}

(and similar for forming the handle_bytes_flags value).

That is well defined and compatible across architectures and compilers and
bearable (although a bit clumsy).

Yeah, you're right. But at this point it can serve us well by making sure
there's no userspace passing absurdly high handle_bytes ;).
