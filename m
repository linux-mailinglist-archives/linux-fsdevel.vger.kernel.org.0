As I tried to explain, I would prefer if we could inform the filesystem
through i_op->update_time() itself that this is async and give the
filesystem the ability to try and acquire the locks it needs and return
EAGAIN from i_op->update_time() itself if it can't acquire them.

Yes, I tend to agree and thought about the same. But right now we don't
have a lot of context. So I would lean towards a flag argument at most.

But I also wouldn't consider it necessarily wrong to start with booleans
or a flag first and in a couple of months if the need for more context
arises we know what kind of struct we want or need.
