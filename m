Really?  I admit I haven't fully followed how the code works, but it
looks like anything that goes through the io_queue_async_work() path
will use sqo_mm, and can't most requests that end up blocking end up
there?  It looks like, even if SQPOLL is not set, the mm used will
depend on whether the request ends up blocking and thus getting queued
for later completion.

Or does some magic I missed make this a nonissue.

I see two fundamental issues:

1. The above.  This may be less of an issue than it seems to me, but,
if you submit io from outside sqo_mm, the mm that ends up being used
depends on whether the IO is completed from io_uring_enter() or from
the workqueue.  For something like Postgres, I guess this is okay
because the memory is MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED and the pointers all
point the same place regardless.

2. If you create an io_uring and io_uring_enter() it from a different
mm, it's unclear what seccomp is supposed to do.  (Or audit, for that
matter.)  Which task did the IO?  Which mm did the IO?  Whose sandbox
is supposed to be applied?
