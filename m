The most common cases where shiftfs is used or where folks would like
to use it today are (by importance):
 - Fast container creation (by not having to uid/gid shift all files
in the downloaded image)
 - Sharing data between the host system and a container (some paths
under /home being the most common)
 - Sharing data between unprivileged containers with a disjointed map
 - Sharing data between multiple containers, some privileged, some unprivileged

Fixing the ulimit issue only takes care of one of those (3rd item), it
does not solve any of the other cases.

The first item on there alone can be quite significant. Creation and
startup of a regular Debian container on my system takes around 500ms
when shiftfs is used (btrfs/lvm/zfs copy-on-write clone of the image,
setup shiftfs, start container) compared to 2-3s when running without
it (same clone, followed by rewrite of all uid/gid present on the fs,
including acls and capabilities, then start container). And that's on
a fast system with an NVME SSD and a small rootfs. We have had reports
of a few users running on slow spinning rust with large containers
where shifting can take several minutes.

The second item can technically be worked around without shifted
bind-mounts by doing userns map hole punching, mapping the user's
uid/gid from the host straight into the container. The downside to
this is that another shifting pass becomes needed for any file outside
of the bind-mounted path (or it would become owned by -1/-1) and it's
very much not dynamic, requiring the container be stopped, config
updated by the user, /etc/subuid and subgid maps being updated and
container started back up. If you need another user/group be exposed,
start all over again...
This is far more complex, slow and disruptive than the shifted
approach where we just need to do:
   lxc config device add MY-CONTAINER home disk source=/home
path=/home shift=true
To inject a new mount of /home from the host into the container with a
shifting layer in place, no need to reconfig subuid/subgid, no need to
re-create the userns to update the mapping and no need to go through
the container's rootfs for any file which may now need remapping
because of the map change.
