*cough*

Extent size hints.

I'm a little disappointed that after all these discussions about how
we decouple extent allocation size and alignment from the user IO
size and alignment with things like extent size hints, force align,
etc that you are still thinking that user IO size and alignment
directly drives extent allocation size and alignment....

Yes, it can. We use it extensively in fstests because it works
for any filesystem, not just XFS.

Please do, then the support is there for developers, users and
fstests without needing to write their own custom test programs.

That's what man pages are for, yes?

Are you expecting your deployments to be run on highly suboptimal
configurations and so the code needs to be optimised for this
behaviour, or are you expecting them to be run on correctly
configured systems which would never see these issues?

Atomic writes are just "other writes". They are writes that are
*expected to fail* if they cannot be done atomically.

Application writers will quickly learn how to do sane, fast,
reliable atomic write IO if we reject anything that is going to
requires some complex, sub-optimal workaround in the kernel to make
it work. The simplest solution is to -fail the write-, because
userspace *must* be prepared for *any* atomic write to fail.

Then we need the tiny write to allocate and zero according to the
maximum sized atomic write bounds. Then we just don't care about
large atomic IO overlapping small IO, because the extent on disk
aligned to the large atomic IO is then always guaranteed to be the
correct size and shape.

Doing it anything in a way that a user can DOS the entire filesystem
is *terrible*. No ifs, buts or otherwise.

Yes, but I also outlined a way that it can be done automatically
without being terrible. There are multiple options here, I outlined
two different approaches that are acceptible.

I never said we can't do zeroing. I just said that it's normally
better when the application controls zeroing directly.

That's not what I said. I said the using sub-rtextsize atomic writes
with single FSB unwritten extent tracking is horrible and
incompatible with doing 16kB atomic writes.

This setup will not work at all well with your patches and should go
BOOM. Using XFS_BMAPI_ZERO is hacking around the fact that the setup
has uncoordinated extent allocation and unwritten conversion
granularity.

That's the fundamental design problem with your approach - it allows
unwritten conversion at *minimum IO sizes* and that does not work
with atomic IOs with larger alignment requirements.

The fundamental design principle is this: for maximally sized atomic
writes to always succeed we require every allocation, zeroing and
unwritten conversion operation to use alignments and sizes that are
compatible with the maximum atomic write sizes being used.

i.e. atomic writes need to use max write size granularity for all IO
operations, not filesystem block granularity.

And that also means things like rtextsize and extsize hints need to
match these atomic write requirements, too....

Ummmm, did you read what you quoted?

The above is an outline of the IO path modifications that will allow
mixed IO sizes to be used with atomic writes without requiring the
XFS_BMAPI_ZERO hack. It pushes the sub-atomic write alignment
zeroing out to the existing DIO sub-block zeroing, hence ensuring
that we only ever convert unwritten extents on max sized atomic
write boundaries for atomic write enabled inodes.

At no point have I said "no mixed writes". I've said no to the
XFS_BMAPI_ZERO hack, but then I've explained the fundamental issue
that it works around and given you a decent amount of detail on how
to sanely implementing mixed write support that will work (slowly)
with those configurations and IO patterns.

So it's your choice - you can continue to beleive I don't mixed
writes to work at all, or you can go back and try to understand the
IO path changes I've suggested that will allow mixed atomic writes
to work as well as they possibly can....
