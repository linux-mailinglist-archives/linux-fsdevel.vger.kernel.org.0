Few more doubts about this (please mark me wrong if that is the case):

- Task-work makes me feel like N completions waiting to be served by
single task.
Currently completions keep arriving and CQEs would be updated with
result, but the user-space (submitter task) would not be poked.

- Completion-code will set the task-work. But post that it cannot go
immediately to its regular business of picking cqe and updating
res/flags, as we cannot afford user-space to see the cqe before the
pointer update. So it seems completion-code needs to spawn another
work which will allocate/update cqe after waiting for pointer-update
from task-work?
