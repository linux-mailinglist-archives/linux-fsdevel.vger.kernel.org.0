Thanks for the details! This is indeed even better. Looking at the tar
archive I can see it consists of a lot of small files big part of them
is even below 10k. So this very much matches the workload I was examining
with reaim where I saw regression (although only ~8%) even on normal
rotating drive on x86 machine. In that case I have pretty much confirmed
that the problem is due to mb_optimize_scan=1 spreading small allocated
files more which is likely also harmful for the SD card because it requires
touching more erase blocks.

Thanks for help with debugging this, I will implement some of the
heuristics we discussed with other ext4 developers to avoid this behavior
and will send you patch for testing.
