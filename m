I made a trivial reproducer just to verify.

It seems sane to me - exit if there's a fatal signal, or doing core
dump. Don't think there should be other conditions.

That's been a long discussion, but it's a different topic really. Yes
it's signals, but it's not this particular issue. It'll happen to work
around this issue, as it cancels everything post core dumping.
