OK, thanks for spelling the use case out, makes it easier to understand
what you need in terms of what we currently can't do.

I think it'd be a cleaner way of doing the same thing as your patch
does. It seems a little odd to do this by default (having the ring
change personalities depending on who's using it), but from an opt-in
point of view, I think it makes more sense.

That would make the IORING_REGISTER_ call something like
IORING_REGISTER_ADOPT_OWNER or something like that, meaning that the
ring would just assume the identify of the task that's calling
io_uring_enter().

Note that this also has to be passed through to the io-wq handler, as
the mappings there are currently static as well.
