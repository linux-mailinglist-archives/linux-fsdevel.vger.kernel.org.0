Ritesh and Ted and Jan and I were chatting during the ext4 concall just
now.  Could we have a 30 minute iomap bof at 2:30pm followed by the XFS
bof after that?  That would give us some time to chat with hch about
iomap (and xfs) direction before he has to leave.

Alternately, we could announce a lunchtime discussion group on Monday
following Ritesh's presentation about iomap.  That could fit everyone's
schedule better?  Also everyone's braincaches will likely be warmer.

Survey: How many people want to attend the xfs bof virtually?

I'd be ok with an OTR discussion with no video, though I reserve the
right to change my mind if the score becomes chair: 2 djwong: 0. :P
