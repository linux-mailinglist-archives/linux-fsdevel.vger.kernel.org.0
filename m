I don't see how would that work for this usecase?  You have to sample
file2 before reflinking file2's contents to file1, writing the changes
to file1, and executing COMMIT_RANGE.  Setting the xfs-private REFLINK
inode flag on file2 will trigger an iversion update even though it won't
change mtime or ctime.  The COMMIT then fails due to the inode flags
change.

Worse yet, applications aren't going to know if a particular access is
actually the one that will trigger an atime update.  So this will just
fail unpredictably.

If iversion was purely a write counter then I would switch the freshness
implementation to use it.  But it's not, and I know this to be true
because I tried that and could not get COMMIT_RANGE to work reliably.
I suppose the advantage of the blob thing is that we actually /can/
switch over whenever it's ready.
