I had implemented this for kernfs and libfs (so sysfs, debugfs, possibly
tmpfs/proc?) in v2

The patch as of v2's mail has a bug, but my branch has it fixed as of
https://github.com/martinetd/linux/commits/io_uring_getdents

(I guess these aren't "real" enough though)

the xfs poc was in this mail:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230501071603.GE2155823@dread.disaster.area/

I never spent time debugging it, but it should definitely be workable
