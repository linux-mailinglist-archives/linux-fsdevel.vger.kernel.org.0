I browse code in i_op->update_time = xfs_vn_update_time, it's mainly
about xfs journal code. It creates a transaction and adds a item to
it, not familiar with this part, from a quick look I found some
locks and sleep point in it to modify. I think I need some time to sort
out this part. Or maybe we can do it like what Dave said as a short term
solution and change the block points in journal code later as a separate
patchset, those journal code I believe are common code for xfs IO
operations. I'm ok with both though.
