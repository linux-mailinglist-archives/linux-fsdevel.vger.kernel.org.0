FIOQSIZE should in fact only be allowed if LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE or
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE or LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR are handled
and explicitly allowed for the FD. I guess FIOQSIZE is allowed without read
nor write mode (i.e. O_PATH), so it could be an issue for landlocked
applications but they can explicitly allow IOCTL for this case. When
we'll have a LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_METADATA (or something similar), we
should also tie FIOQSIZE to this access right, and we'll be able to
fully handle all the use cases without fully allowing all other IOCTLs.

We need to handle FIOQSIZE as done by do_vfs_ioctl: add the same i_mode
checks. A kselftest test should check that ENOTTY is returned according
to the file type and the access rights.
