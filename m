I had thought about it but afaict it'd be rather annoying as one can get
into that code from copy_file_range() as well so we'd need a new flag
for that system call as well afaict.

I think hanging for an insane amount of time is indeed a problem and
tweaking the code in this way might actually be useful but we'd need to
let this soak for quite a while to see whether this causes any issues.

@Jens, what do you think? Is this worth it?
