Interesting...  I guess eparis would be the next victim^Wpossible source
of information.

Heh...  I suggest you to look at the manpage of that thing.

sysfs(1, "ext2") => echo $((`sed -ne "/\text2$/=" </proc/filesystems` - 1))
sysfs(2, 10) => sed -ne "11s/.*\t//p" </proc/filesystems
sysfs(3) => wc -l </proc/filesystems

Yes, really - find position of filesystem type in the list of registered
filesystems by name (0-based numeration), find the name of filesystem
type by position and find the number of registered filesystem types.
Missed'em'V had no synthetic filesystems...

And the string is, of course, not a pathname of any sort, so I'd argue that
spewing PATH record into audit log is a bug.  Not that the number you get
from sysfs(1, something) had been usable for anything other than passing it
to sysfs(2, number) and getting the same string back - you can't pass that
number to mount(2) or anything of that kind.  I suspect that the only
reason this syscall exists is some binary emulation - introduced in 1.1.11,
not supported by glibc at least since 2014 (and almost certainly way before
that).

Huh?  Right now we allocate audit_names at getname_flags()/getname_kernel()
time; grep for audit_getname() - that's as centralized as it gets.
What I want to do is somewhat _de_centralize it; that way they would not
go anywhere other than audit_context of the thread actually doing the
work.

There is a lot of calls of audit_inode(), but I'm not planning to touch
any of those.
