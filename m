Yes I meant write from the userspace. Sorry for the confusion here.

So it means that even though h/w may support atomic-write crossing natural alignment boundary, the kernel would still reject it.

Indeed, for FSes, we do not have a direct linear map from FS blocks to physical blocks, so it would be impossible for the user to know about a boundary condition in this context.

Hmm OK, thanks for that explanation. 

Thanks,
