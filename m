Tbh, the idea itself of exporting pidfs via nfs is a) crazy and b)
pretty interesting. If we could really export pidfs over NFS cleanly
somehow then we would have a filesystem-like representation of a remote
machine's processes. There could be a lot of interesting things in this.
But I would think that this requires some proper massaging of how pidfs
works. But in principle it might be possible.

Again, I'm not saying it's a great idea and we definitely shouldn't do
it now. But it's an interesting thought experiment at least.
