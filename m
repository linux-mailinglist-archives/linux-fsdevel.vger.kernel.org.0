Hi Andreas,

Thanks for your review in advance. :)

I'm a little confused, IIUC, IOMAP_TAIL and FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_TAIL are with
different semantics:

- IOMAP_TAIl:
  we may introduce this flag to cover tail-packing case, in where we merge
small-sized data in the tail of file into free space of its metadata.
- FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_TAIL:
quoted from Documentation/filesystems/fiemap.txt
"  This will also set FIEMAP_EXTENT_NOT_ALIGNED
Data is packed into a block with data from other files."
It looks like this flag indicates that blocks from different files stores into
one common block.

I'm not familiar with fiemap flags' history, but maybe FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_TAIL
should be better to rename to FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_PACKING to avoid ambiguity. And
then FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_INLINE will be enough to cover normal inline case and
tail-packing case?

Why can't #0 page consist of more than one block/mapping? I didn't get what's
difference here.

> to be block aligned. If the block size is smaller than the page size,

- reiserfs tries to find last page's content, if the size of that page's valid
content is smaller than threshold (at least less than one block), reiserfs can
do the packing.

- erofs' block size is 4kb which is the same as page size.

Actually, for IOMAP_TAIL, there is no users who need to map more than one block
into metadata, so I'm not sure that we should support that, or we just need to
let code preparing for that to those potential users?

Thanks,
