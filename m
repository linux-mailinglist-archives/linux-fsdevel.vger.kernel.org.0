I think that moving to directly passing vbox PAGELIST structs on
read is something which should not be too much work.

Moving to an async model is a lot more involved and has a much
larger chance of causing problems. So we need not only someone
to step up to not only make the change to async, but that person
also need to commit to help with maintaining vboxsf going forward,
esp. wrt debug + fix any problems stemming from the move to async
which are likely to only pop up much later as more and more
distros move to the new code.

Regards,

Hans
