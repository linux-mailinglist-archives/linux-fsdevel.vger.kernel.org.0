Maybe. On the other hand you seem to ignore what I'm saying. You
currently don't have a clear set of rules for when it's ok for someone
to send patches and request access to bpf kfuncs to implement a new BPF
program. This patchset very much illustrates this point. The safety
properties of bpf don't matter for this. And again, your safety
properties very much didn't protect you from your bpf_d_path() mess.

We're not even clearly told where and how these helper are supposed to be
used. That's not ok and will never be ok. As long as there are no clear
criteria to operate under this is highly problematic. This may be fine
from a bpf perspective and one can even understand why because that's
apparently your model or promise to your users. But there's no reason to
expect the same level of laxness from any of the subsystems you're
requesting kfuncs from.

No. The reason it was exported was because of the drm subsystem and we
already quite disliked that. But it turned out that's not needed so in
commit 61d4fb0b349e ("file, i915: fix file reference for
mmap_singleton()") they were moved away from this helper.

And then we simply forgot to unexport it.

A helper such as get_file_rcu() is called on a file object that is
subject to SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU semantics where the caller doesn't hold
a reference. The semantics of that are maybe understood by a couple of
people in the kernel. There is absolutely no way that any userspace will
get access to such low-level helpers. They have zero business to be
involved in the lifetimes of objects on this level just as no module has.

So really, this is an orthogonal cleanup.
