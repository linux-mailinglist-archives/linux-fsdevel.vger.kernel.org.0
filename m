How do filesystem users pick a write stream?  I get a pretty strong
sense that you're aiming to provide the ability for application software
to group together a bunch of (potentially arbitrary) files in a cohort.
Then (maybe?) you can say "This cohort of files are all expected to have
data blocks related to each other in some fashion, so put them together
so that the storage doesn't have to work so hard".

Part of my comprehension problem here (and probably why few fs people
commented on this thread) is that I have no idea what FDP is, or what
the write lifetime hints in scsi were/are, or what the current "hinting"
scheme is.

Is this what we're arguing about?

enum rw_hint {
	WRITE_LIFE_NOT_SET	= RWH_WRITE_LIFE_NOT_SET,
	WRITE_LIFE_NONE		= RWH_WRITE_LIFE_NONE,
	WRITE_LIFE_SHORT	= RWH_WRITE_LIFE_SHORT,
	WRITE_LIFE_MEDIUM	= RWH_WRITE_LIFE_MEDIUM,
	WRITE_LIFE_LONG		= RWH_WRITE_LIFE_LONG,
	WRITE_LIFE_EXTREME	= RWH_WRITE_LIFE_EXTREME,
} __packed;

(What happens if you have two disjoint sets of files, both of which are
MEDIUM, but they shouldn't be intertwined?)

Or are these new fdp hint things an overload of the existing write hint
fields in the iocb/inode/bio?  With a totally different meaning from
anticipated lifetime of the data blocks?

If Christoph is going where I think he's going with xfs, then maybe the
idea here is to map allocation groups on the realtime volume (i.e.
rtgroups) to a zone (or a flash channel?), along with the ability for
user programs to say "allocations to this cohort of files should all
come from the same rtgroup".

But.  The cohort associations exist entirely in the filesystem, so the
filesystem gets to figure out the association between rtgroup and
whatever scsi/nvme/fdp/whatever hints it sends the hardware.  The
mappings will all be to the same LBA space, but that's the filesystem's
quirk, not necessarily a signal to the storage.

Writes within a cohort will target a single rtgroup until it fills up,
at which point we pick another rtgroup and start filling that.
Eventually something comes along to gc the surviving allocations in the
old rtgroups.  (Aside: the xfs filestreams thing that Dave mentioned
upthread does something kind of like this, except that user programs
cannot convey cohort associations to the filesystem.)

AFAICT the cohort associations are a file property, which the filesystem
can persist in whatever way it wants -- e.g. (ab)using the u32 xfs
project id.  Is there any use using a different cohort id for a specific
IO?  I don't think there are any.

I suppose if your application wants to talk directly to a block device
then I could see why you'd want to be able to send write hints or fdp
placement whatevers directly to the storage, but I don't think that's
the majority of application programs.  Or to put it another way -- you
can plumb in a blockdev-only direct interface to the storage hints, but
us filesystem folks will design whatever makes the most sense for us,
and will not probably not provide direct access to those hints.  After
all, the whole point of xfs is to virtualize a block device.

<shrug> Just my ignorant 2c.  Did that help, or did I just pour gasoline
on a flamewar?
