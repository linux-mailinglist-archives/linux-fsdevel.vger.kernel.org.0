What iomap is doing is correct behaviour. IOCB_NOWAIT applies to the
filesystem behaviour, not the block device.

REQ_NOWAIT can result in partial IO failures because the error is
only reported to the iomap layer via IO completions. Hence we can
split a DIO into multiple bios and have random bios in that IO fail
with EAGAIN because REQ_NOWAIT is set. This error will
get reported to the submitter via completion, and it will override
any of the partial IOs that actually completed.

Hence, like the recently reported multi-mapping IOCB_NOWAIT bug
reported by Jens and fixed in commit 883a790a8440 ("xfs: don't allow
NOWAIT DIO across extent boundaries") we'll get silent partial
writes occurring because the second submitted bio in an IO can
trigger EAGAIN errors with partial IO completion having already
occurred.

Further, we don't allow partial IO completion for DIO on XFS at all.
DIO must be completely submitted and completed or return an error
without having issued any IO at all.  Hence using REQ_NOWAIT for
DIO bios is incorrect and not desirable.

Cheers,

Dave.
