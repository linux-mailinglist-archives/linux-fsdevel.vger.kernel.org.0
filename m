Yes if the block device doesn't support iopoll, then HIPRI pread/pwrite 
will automatically

gets downgraded from polling mode.

Indeed that's true. iopoll gets disabled once the dio gets split,
even though the block device has thousands of queue depth. This
design is chose just because it is the simplest one..., though
this one should have no big problem.

As I described in the comment, iopoll is initially for small size
IO. We have ever tested the latency of Optane SSD

bs | latency (us)

---- | ----

read 4k | 14

read 128k | 68

write 4k | 17

write 128k | 75


The overhead of interrupt is about several (under 10) microseconds. The 
overhead of

interrupt when doing 128k IO may not be as important as that of small 
size IO, thus

the performance gain of iopoll will decreased a lot at least for 128k IO.


In my computer, @max_sectors of one nvme SSD is 128k, so the split bio 
is much

likely larger than 128k, in which case the performance loss should be 
acceptable

(though I have not test it).
