I can imagine that alternative application to "ls -l" or "stat" could
want to show some of those new flags. So to prevent storm of stat and
getxattr syscalls, there can be one syscall (e.g. part of the statx)
which could serve all information. But this is just my imagination...

Anyway, there is already such application and it is wine. WinAPI
functions which are equivalent to Linux stat function are already
returning all those flags.

In the same way flags are part of the basic SMB stat operation, so Samba
or ksmbd would have to always ask for all of them.
