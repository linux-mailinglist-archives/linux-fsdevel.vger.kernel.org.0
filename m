But we need hints to put files together. I believe you do this already,
as no placement protocol gives you unlimited separation.

Maybe you can post some patches on the parts dedicated to the VFS level
and user-space API (syscall or uring)?

Following on the comment to Christoph, it would be good to have
something tangible to work together on for the next stage of this
support.

For FS users, makes a lot of sense. But we still need to cover
applications using raw block.
