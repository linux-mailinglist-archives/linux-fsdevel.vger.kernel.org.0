Having not been following init_on_alloc very closely myself, I'm a bit surprised
that an opt-out flag never made it into the final version.

Was names_cachep considered in those earlier discussions?  I think that's a
pretty obvious use case for an opt-out.  Every syscall that operates on a path
allocates a 4K buffer from names_cachep.
