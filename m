Won't it happen one page sooner? I.e. on single page writes we'll
end up throttling *before* we dirty the page, not *after* we dirty
the page. IOWs, we can't wait for the page that we just dirtied to
be cleaned to make progress and so this now makes the loop dependent
on pages dirtied by other writers being cleaned to guarantee
forwards progress?

That seems like a subtle but quite significant change of
algorithm...

Hmmm. I see a what looks to be an undesirable pattern here...

1. Memory allocation failure here on the second page of a write.

2. we break and return 4kB from the first page copied.

3. This sets iter.processed = 4kB, and we call iomap_iter() again.
This sees iter.processed > 0 and there's still more to write, so
it returns 1, and go around the loop again.

Hence spurious memory allocation failures in the IOMAP_NOWAIT will
not cause this buffered write loop to exit. Worst case, we fail
allocation on every second __iomap_write_begin() call and so the
write takes much longer and consume lots more CPU hammering memory
alocation because no single memory allocation will cause the write
to return a short write to the caller.

This seems undesirable to me. If we are failing memory allocations,
we need to back off, not hammer memory allocation harder without
allowing reclaim to make progress...

Cheers,

Dave.
