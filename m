Yeah, we have touched on that already and we have other APIs having
related problems. A clean way to avoid this problem is to require new
syscalls to either have two flag arguments, or - if appropriate -
suggest they make use of struct open_how that was implemented for
openat2().

 * @flags: O_* flags.
 * @mode: O_CREAT/O_TMPFILE file mode.
 * @resolve: RESOLVE_* flags.

struct open_how {
	__u64 flags;
	__u64 mode;
	__u64 resolve;
};
