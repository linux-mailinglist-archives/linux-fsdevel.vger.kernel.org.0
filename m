Hrm.  I *thought* that since FUSE_INIT isn't queued as a background
command, it should still execute in the same process context as the fuse
server.

OTOH it also occurs to me that I have this code in fuse_send_init:

	if (has_capability_noaudit(current, CAP_SYS_RAWIO))
		flags |= FUSE_IOMAP | FUSE_IOMAP_DIRECTIO | FUSE_IOMAP_PAGECACHE;
	...
	ia->in.flags = flags;
	ia->in.flags2 = flags >> 32;

which means that we only advertise iomap support in FUSE_INIT if the
process running fuse_fill_super (which you hope is the fuse server)
actually has CAP_SYS_RAWIO.  Would that work for you?  Or are you
dropping privileges before you even open /dev/fuse?

Note: I might decide to relax that approach later on, since iomap
requires you to have opened a block device ... which implies that the
process had read/write access to start with; and maybe we're ok with
unprivileged fuse2fs servers running on a chmod 666 block device?

<shrug> always easier to /relax/ the privilege checks. :)

..."I don't know what his motivations for synchronous FUSE_INIT are."

I guess I fubard vim. :(

Well it's not as simple as device-mapper, where we can intercept struct
bio and remap/split it to our heart's content.  I guess you could do
that with an iovec...?  Would be sorta amusing if you could software
RAID10 some DRAM. :P
