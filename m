Nah. What I wrote above is drastically simplified. It's IRL more
complex. Specific services need to be killed between certain mounts
are unmounted, since they are a backend for another mount. NFS, or
FUSE or stuff like that usually has some processes backing them
around, and we need to stop the mounts they provide before these
services, and then the mounts these services reside on after that, and
so on. It's a complex dependency tree of stuff that needs to be done
in order, so that we can deal with arbitrarily nested mounts, storage
subsystems, and backing services.

Anyway, this all works fine in systemd, the dependency logic is
there. We want a more efficient way to watch mounts, that's
all. Subscribing and constantly reparsing /proc/self/mountinfo is
awful, that's all.
