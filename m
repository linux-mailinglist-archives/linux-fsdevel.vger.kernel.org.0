The pipe_write case is a good case to consider.  In general filesystems
are only allowed to stop if fatal_signal_pending.  It is an ancient
unix/posix thing.

I would very much like some clarity on TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL.  At the very
least it would be nice if it could get renamed TIF_NOTIFY_TASK_WORK.
I don't know what it has to do with signals.

Given that the code needs to handle pipes that seems a reasonable thing
to do.  Note.  All of the blocking of new signals in prepare_signal
is still in place.  So only a SIGKILL can come in set TIF_SIGPENDING.

So I would say that the current fix is correct (and safe to backport).
But still requires some magic in prepare_signal until we do more.

I don't understand the logic with well enough of adding work to
non-io_uring threads with task_work_add to understand why that happens
in the first place.

There are a lot of silly corners here.  Yes please let's keep on
digging.

Eric
