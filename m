I was hoping to give a more concrete solution but have other
distractions at the moment.  My concern is adding it later once the
message format is committed.  We have too many field orderings already.
Recognizing this adds useless characters to the record type at this
time, I'm even thinking auid=? ses=? until a solution can be found.

So you are sure the rest of the creds are correct?

Understood, no problem here.
