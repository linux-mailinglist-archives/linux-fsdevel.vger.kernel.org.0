Or rather trying to claim all these are "write hints" is simply the wrong
approach :)

That's a very nice but almost to harmless way to phrase it.

This is very similar to what the never followed up upon Kanchan did.

I think this is a lot better than blindly overloading a generic
"write hint", but still suffers from problems:

 a) the code is a lot more complex and harder to maintain than just two
    different values
 b) it still keeps the idea that a simple temperature hint and write
    stream or placement identifiers are someting comparable, which they
    really aren't.

The file system is, and always has been, the entity in charge of
resource allocation of the underlying device.  Bypassing it will get
you in trouble, and a simple mount option isn't really changing that
(it's also not exactly a scalable interface).

If an application wants to micro-manage placement decisions it should not
use a file system, or at least not a normal one with Posix semantics.
That being said we'd demonstrated that applications using proper grouping
of data by file and the simple temperature hints can get very good result
from file systems that can interpret them, without a lot of work in the
file system.  I suspect for most applications that actually want files
that is actually going to give better results than trying to do the
micro-management that tries to bypass the file system.

I'm not sure if Keith was just ranting last night, but IFF the assumption
here is that file systems are just used as dumb containers and applications
manage device level placement inside them we have a much deeper problem
than just interface semantics.
