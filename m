You know my feelings on audit record field orderings, so let's not
follow that distraction right now.

Regarding proactively inserting a placeholder for auid= and ses=, I'm
reasonably convinced it is not practical, and likely not possible, to
capture that information for the audit record.  As a result, I see no
reason to waste the space in the record.  However, if you  (or anyone
else for that matter) can show that we can reliably capture that
information then I'm in complete agreement that it should be added.

What I'm not going to do is hold this patchset any longer on a vague
feeling that it should be possible.  On the plus side I'm only merging
this into selinux/next, not selinux/stable-5.15, so worst case you
have a couple more weeks before things are "set".  I realize we all
have competing priorities, but as the saying goes, "it's time to put
up or shut up" ;)

> So you are sure the rest of the creds are correct?

Yes, the credentials that are logged in audit_log_uring() are all
taken from the currently executing task via a call to current_cred().
Regardless of the io_uring calling context (synchronous, io-wq,
sqpoll) the current_cred() call should always return the correct
credentials; look at how io_uring manages credentials in
io_issue_sqe().  While the audit log treats the audit ID just as if it
were another credential on the system, it is definitely not like a
normal credential and requires special handling; this is why there was
the mixup where I mistakenly left it in the audit record, and one of
the reasons why we will not always have a valid audit ID for io_uring
operations.
