This is PL_LOGINFO_CODE_SATA_NCQ_FAIL_ALL_CMDS_AFTR_ERR, so you got an NCQ
error which blows up the device queue, as usual with SATA.

Hmmm... DID_SOFT_ERROR... Normally, this is an immediate retry as this normally
is used to indicate that a command is a collateral abort due to an NCQ error,
and per ATA spec, that command should be retried. However, the *BAD* thing
about Broadcom HBAs using this is that it increments the command retry counter,
so if a command ends up being retried more than 5 times due to other commands
failing, the command runs out of retries and is failed like this. The command
retry counter should *not* be incremented for NCQ collateral aborts. I tried to
fix this, but it is impossible as we actually do not know if this is a
collateral abort or something else. The HBA events used to handle completion do
not allow differentiation. Waiting on Broadcom to do something about this (the
mpi3mr HBA driver has the same nasty issue).

Here is the culprit causing the collateral aborts. This is a read command
trying to read a dead sector. It fails and causes all the other
"DID_SOFT_ERROR" failures above due to its retries and repeated failures (it
blows up the command queue every time, causing the same commands to be subject
to the collateral abort retries and running out of retries).

So you get also writes being failed, likely due to the same reason (running out
of retries).

Yes, a Broadcom HAB. As explained, these have an issue with handling retries of
collateral aborts in the presence of NCQ errors. In your case, the NCQ errors
are due to attempt to read bad sectors, which normally should only result in
EIO errors sent back to the user if the reads are for file data. If the reads
are for FS metadata, the FS likely would go read-only.

But the driver using DID_SOFT_ERROR for retrying commands that where not in
error but aborted due to an NCQ error causes failures because of the invalid
handling of the command retry count. libata does things correctly:

/**
 *      ata_eh_qc_retry - Tell midlayer to retry an ATA command after EH
 *      @qc: Command to retry
 *
 *      Indicate to the mid and upper layers that an ATA command
 *      should be retried.  To be used from EH.
 *
 *      SCSI midlayer limits the number of retries to scmd->allowed.
 *      scmd->allowed is incremented for commands which get retried
 *      due to unrelated failures (qc->err_mask is zero).
 */
void ata_eh_qc_retry(struct ata_queued_cmd *qc)
{
        struct scsi_cmnd *scmd = qc->scsicmd;
        if (!qc->err_mask)
                scmd->allowed++;
        __ata_eh_qc_complete(qc);
}

However, for a SAS connected ATA drive, this is not the code used. It is either
the HBA FW handling the retries (transparently to the host), or the HBA uses
the host to resend commands to the drive (which is what mpt3sas does). We
really need to fix that mess as it causes hard-to-debug IO failures that are
really hard to understand unless you know what to look for.

I have yet to come up with a good solution though.
