Reword / reorganize things a little bit into "lists", so new features /
modes / ioctls can sort of just be appended.

Describe how UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR and UFFDIO_CONTINUE can be used
to intercept and resolve minor faults. Make it clear that COPY and
ZEROPAGE are used for MISSING faults, whereas CONTINUE is used for MINOR
faults.

+Resolving Userfaults
+--------------------
+
+There are three basic ways to resolve userfaults:
+
+- ``UFFDIO_COPY`` atomically copies some existing page contents from
+  userspace.
+
+- ``UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE`` atomically zeros the new page.
+
+- ``UFFDIO_CONTINUE`` maps an existing, previously-populated page.
+
+These operations are atomic in the sense that they guarantee nothing can
+see a half-populated page, since readers will keep userfaulting until the
+operation has finished.
+
+By default, these wake up userfaults blocked on the range in question.
+They support a ``UFFDIO_*_MODE_DONTWAKE`` ``mode`` flag, which indicates
+that waking will be done separately at some later time.
+
+Which of these are used depends on the kind of fault:
+
+- For ``UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING`` faults, a new page has to be
+  provided. This can be done with either ``UFFDIO_COPY`` or
+  ``UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE``. The default (non-userfaultfd) behavior would be to
+  provide a zero page, but in userfaultfd this is left up to userspace.
+
+- For ``UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR`` faults, an existing page already
+  exists. Userspace needs to ensure its contents are correct (if it needs
+  to be modified, by writing directly to the non-userfaultfd-registered
+  side of shared memory), and then issue ``UFFDIO_CONTINUE`` to resolve
+  the fault.
 
 Notes:
 
-- If you requested ``UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING`` when registering then
-  you must provide some kind of page in your thread after reading from
