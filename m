Yep, just refactoring out those bits as a prep thing. rsrc could work,
or perhaps a new file for that.

Thanks!

Yeah, on a second look, as these are just using the normal read/write
path after that should be fine indeed.

I haven't checked the rest, but you can't just use ->splice_flags for
this?

In any case, the get path needs to look like io_tee() here, and:

>>> +out_put_fd:
>>> +	if (splice_fd.file)
>>> +		fdput(splice_fd);

this put needs to be gated on whether it's a fixed file or not.

I mean when you clear that flag, call the cleanup bits you otherwise
would've called on later cleanup.
