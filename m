Why is a another function in charge of checking the return value of an
initialization function. If something like path_init() fails why is the
next caller responsible for rejecting it's return value and then we're
passing that failure value through the whole function with if (!err)
ladders but as I said it's mostly style preferences.

I'm confused why having callers of functions responsible for checking
error values is such an out-of-band concept suddenly. I don't think it's
worth arguing over this though.

Hm? Are you maybe overlooking path_init() which assigns straight into
the variable declaration? Or are you referring to sm else?

static int path_lookupat(struct nameidata *nd, unsigned flags, struct path *path)
{
	const char *s = path_init(nd, flags);
	int err;

	if (unlikely(flags & LOOKUP_DOWN) && !IS_ERR(s)) {
		err = handle_lookup_down(nd);
		if (unlikely(err < 0))
			s = ERR_PTR(err);
	}

	while (!(err = link_path_walk(s, nd)) &&
	       (s = lookup_last(nd)) != NULL)
		;
