To reiterate what hch said - this "opt in" is wrong.  Out-of-tree
code that does async IO on bvec-backed iov_iter, setting it up on
its own will have to adapt, that all.

iov_iter and its users are already in serious need of simplification
and cleanups; piling more on top of that would be a bloody bad idea.

Proposed semantics change for bvec-backed iov_iter makes a lot of sense,
so let's make sure that everything in tree can live with it, document
the change and switch to better semantics.

This thing should be unconditional.  Document it in D/f/porting and
if something out of tree complains, it's their problem - not ours.
