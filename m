I think history told us that the discussions always go like "but user 
space wants more control, let's give user space all the power", and a 
couple of months later we get "but we cannot possibly enlighten all 
applications, and user space does not have sufficient information: we 
need the kernel to handle this transparently."

It seems to be a steady back and forth. Most probably we want something 
in between: cxl-as-numa-node model is already a pretty good and 
simplistic abstractions. Avoid too many new special user-space knobs is 
most probably the way to go.

Interesting discussion, I agree. And we had plenty of similar ones 
already with PMEM and NUMA in general.
