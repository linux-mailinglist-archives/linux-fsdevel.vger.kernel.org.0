Still hadn't finished with the zoo...

Interesting...  FWIW, *anything* that wants several descriptors has
special needs - there are some places like that (binder, for one)
and they have rather weird code implementing those.

Just to restate the obvious: this is not applicable for the most frequent
caller - open(2).  For the reasons that have nothing to do with performance.
If opening the file has hard-to-reverse side effects (like directory
modification due to O_CREAT), the things are very different.

What I hope for is a small number of patterns, with clear rules for
choosing the one that is applicable and helpers for each that would
reduce the amount of headache when using it.  And I've no problem
with "this particular pattern is not usable if you are adding more
than one descriptor" - that's not hard to understand and verify.
So I'm fine with doing that for one descriptor only and getting
rid of the allocation.

BTW, another pattern is the same sans the "delayed" part.  I.e.
"here's an opened file, get a descriptor and either attach the
file to it or fput() the damn thing; in any case, file reference
is consumed and descriptor-or-error is returned".  That one is
definitely only for single descriptor case.

In any case, I want to finish the survey of the callers first, just to
see what's there and whether anything is worth nicking.

While we are at it, I want to make close_fd() use a very big red flag.
To the point of grepping for new callers in -next and asking the folks
who introduce those to explain WTF they are doing...
