Hi G端nther, this looks good!

Yes, that's a good approach.

Extending the sandboxer should be straightforward, you can just extend 
the scope of LL_FS_RW, taking into account the system Landlock ABI 
because there is no "contract" for this sample.

You'll need to remove the warning about truncate(2) in the 
documentation, and maybe to move it to the "previous limitations" 
section, with the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_TRUNCATE doc pointing to it. I think 
it would be nice to extend the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE documentation to 
point to LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE because this distinction could be 
disturbing for users. Indeed, all inode-based LSMs (SELinux and Smack) 
deny such action if the inode is not writable (with the inode_permission 
check), which is not the case for path-based LSMs (AppArmor and Tomoyo).

While we may question whether a dedicated access right should be added 
for the Landlock use case, two arguments are in favor of this approach:
- For compatibility reasons, the kernel must follow the semantic of a 
specific Landlock ABI, otherwise it could break user space. We could 
still backport this patch and merge it with the ABI 1 and treat it as a 
bug, but the initial version of Landlock was meant to be an MVP, hence 
this lack of access right.
- There is a specific access right for Capsicum (CAP_FTRUNCATE) that 
could makes more sense in the future.

Following the Capsicum semantic, I think it would be a good idea to also 
check for the O_TRUNC open flag:
