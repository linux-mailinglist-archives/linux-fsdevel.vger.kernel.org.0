Not sure if there isn't some misunderstanding so I'll repeat what I've
said: Yes, above path will not account as IO wait time and IMO that is much
more common path which should be accounted as IO wait time. So I think that
without fixing that path, fixing cornercases like you did in your patch is
rather pointless.
