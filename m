Indeed it makes sense to use RESOLVE_MAYEXEC for the dynamic linker too.
Only the noexec mount option is taken into account for mmap(2) with
PROT_EXEC, and if you can trick the dynamic linker with JOP as Jann
explained, it may enable to execute new code. However, a kernel which
forbids remapping memory with PROT_EXEC still enables to implement a W^X
policy. Any JOP/ROP still enables unexpected code execution though.

As it is written in the documentation patch, this RESOLVE_MAYEXEC
feature is an important missing piece, but to implement a consistent
security policy we need to enable other restrictions starting with a
noexec mount point policy. The purpose of this patch series is not to
bring a full-feature LSM with process states handling, but it brings
what is needed for LSMs such as SELinux, IMA or IPE to extend their
capabilities to reach what you would expect.
