I'm not just new to memory ordering, I'm also new to kernel internals :)

To me it looks like iopoll is basically a busy-loop interface; it helps
making things move forward more quickly, while they still might (or
might not) finish on their own.

And io_do_iopoll simply loops over all requests and runs a single
iteration for them, or, if there is only one request
("!poll_multi_file"), it tells it to spin internally.

While there are multiple requests it can't spin in a single request
anyway, and I don't see why it couldn't also check for completion of
non-polled requests after looping over the polled requests (whether by
only checking the CQ tail or actively tracking (why would that be bad?)
the requests some other way).  This only means that as long there are
non-polled requests pending it mustn't spin in a single request.

And if there are no polled-requests at all it could use io_cqring_wait.

So I don't see why it would be impossible to mix polled and non-polled
IO requests.

Any hints what I'm missing here?

(Even if it turns out to be impossible I still think requiring RWF_HIPRI
would be the right way, but well...)

cheers,
Stefan
