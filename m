For IMA copying up security.ima is fine.  Other than EVM portable
signatures, security.evm contains filesystem specific metadata. 
Copying security.evm up only works if the metadata is the same on both
filesystems.  Currently the i_generation and i_sb->s_uuid are
different.

Writing security.evm requires the existing security.evm to be valid. 
After each security xattr in the protected list is modified,
security.evm HMAC needs to be updated.  Perhaps calculating and writing
security.evm could be triggered by security_inode_copy_up_xattr(). 
Just copying a non-portable EVM signature wouldn't work, or for that
matter copying an EVM HMAC with different filesystem metadata.

Thanks Roberto for all your work and analysis.  I'm still looking at
security_inode_copy_up_xattr().
