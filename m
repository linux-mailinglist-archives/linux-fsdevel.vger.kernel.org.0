The following is a non-professional analysis of the algorithm.

Let's first analyze the average time complexity of the new algorithm, as
it is relatively easy to analyze. The maximum number of branches for
internal nodes in a maple tree in allocation mode is 10. However, to
simplify the analysis, we will not consider this case and assume that
all nodes have a maximum of 16 branches.

The new algorithm assumes that there is no case where a VMA with the
VM_DONTCOPY flag is deleted. If such a case exists, this analysis cannot
be applied.

The operations of the new algorithm consist of three parts:

1. DFS traversal of each node in the source tree
2. For each node in the source tree, create a copy and construct a new
    node
3. Traverse the new tree using mas_find() and replace each element

If there are a total of n elements in the maple tree, we can conclude
that there are n/16 leaf nodes. Regarding the second-to-last level, we
can conclude that there are n/16^2 nodes. The total number of nodes in
the entire tree is given by the sum of n/16 + n/16^2 + n/16^3 + ... + 1.
This is a geometric progression with a total of log base 16 of n terms.
According to the formula for the sum of a geometric progression, the sum
is (n-1)/15. So, this tree has a total of (n-1)/15 nodes and
(n-1)/15 - 1 edges.

For the operations in the first part of this algorithm, since DFS
traverses each edge twice, the time complexity would be
2*((n-1)/15 - 1).

For the second part, each operation involves copying a node and making
necessary modifications. Therefore, the time complexity is
16*(n-1)/15.

For the third part, we use mas_find() to traverse and replace each
element, which is essentially similar to the combination of the first
and second parts. mas_find() traverses all nodes and within each node,
it iterates over all elements and performs replacements. The time
complexity of traversing the nodes is 2*((n-1)/15 - 1), and for all
nodes, the time complexity of replacing all their elements is
16*(n-1)/15.

By ignoring all constant factors, each of the three parts of the
algorithm has a time complexity of O(n). Therefore, this new algorithm
is O(n).

The exact time complexity of the old algorithm is difficult to analyze.
I can only provide an upper bound estimation. There are two possible
scenarios for each insertion:

1. Appending at the end of a node.
2. Splitting nodes multiple times.

For the first scenario, the individual operation has a time complexity
of O(1). As for the second scenario, it involves node splitting. The
challenge lies in determining which insertions trigger splits and how
many splits occur each time, which is difficult to calculate. In the
worst-case scenario, each insertion requires splitting the tree's height
log(n) times. Assuming every insertion is in the worst-case scenario,
the time complexity would be n*log(n). However, not every insertion
requires splitting, and the number of splits each time may not
necessarily be log(n). Therefore, this is an estimation of the upper
bound.

Unfortunately, it cannot be done this way. I fell into this trap before,
and it caused incomplete page table cleanup. To solve this problem, the
only solution I can think of right now is to add an additional
parameter.

free_pgtables() will be called in unmap_region() to free the page table,
like this:

free_pgtables(&tlb, mas, vma, prev ? prev->vm_end : FIRST_USER_ADDRESS,
		next ? next->vm_start : USER_PGTABLES_CEILING,
		mm_wr_locked);

The problem is with 'next'. Our 'vma_end' does not exist in the actual
mmap because it has not been duplicated and cannot be used as 'next'.
If there is a real 'next', we can use 'next->vm_start' as the ceiling,
which is not a problem. If there is no 'next' (next is 'vma_end'), we
can only use 'USER_PGTABLES_CEILING' as the ceiling. Using
'vma_end->vm_start' as the ceiling will cause the page table not to be
fully freed, which may be related to alignment in 'free_pgd_range()'. To
solve this problem, we have to introduce 'tree_end', and separating
'tree_end' and 'ceiling' can solve this problem.
