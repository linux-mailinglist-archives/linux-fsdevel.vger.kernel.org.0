If a system contains both CXL attached DRAM and, let say, a byte-addressable CXL SSD - both used as (different) byte addressable tiers in a tiered memory hierarchy, allocating memory from the ZONE_EXMEM doesnât really tell you much about what you get. So the client would still need an orthogonal method to characterize the desired performance characteristics. This method could be combined with a fabric independent zone such as ZONE_PREFER_MOVABLE to address the kernel allocation issue. At the same time, this new zone could also be useful in other cases, such as virtio-mem.

From a MM point of view on the movability aspect, a kernel context is not allocated from ZONE_EXMEM without using GFP_EXMEM explicitly.
In contrast, if we understand the design of ZONE_PREFER_MOVABLE correctly, a kernel context can be allocated from ZONE_PREFER_MOVABLE implicitly as the fallback of ZONE_NORMAL allocation.
However, the movable attribute is not all we are concerning.
In addition, we experienced page allocation and migration issue on the heterogeneous memories.

Given our experiences/design and industry's viewpoints/inquiries,
I will prepare a few slides in the session to explain 
  1. Usecase - user/kernespace memory tiering for near/far placement, memory virtualization between hypervisor/baremetal OS
  2. Issue - movability(movable/unmovable), allocation(explicit/implicit), migration(intented/unintended)
  3. HW - topology(direct, switch, fabric), feature(pluggability,error-handling,etc)
