I'm likely just missing context and am curious about this so bear with me. Why
do we need to flag the upper inode for a logged i_version update? Any required
i_version interactions should've already happened when overlayfs called into
the upper layer. So all that's left to do is for overlayfs' to mirror the
i_version value after the upper operation has returned.

ovl_copyattr() - which copies the inode attributes - is always called after the
operation on the upper inode has finished. So the additional query seems odd at
first glance. But there might well be a good reason for it. In my naive
approach I would've thought that sm along the lines of:

diff --git a/fs/overlayfs/util.c b/fs/overlayfs/util.c
index 923d66d131c1..8b089035b9b3 100644
--- a/fs/overlayfs/util.c
+++ b/fs/overlayfs/util.c
@@ -1119,4 +1119,5 @@ void ovl_copyattr(struct inode *inode)
        inode->i_mtime = realinode->i_mtime;
        inode->i_ctime = realinode->i_ctime;
        i_size_write(inode, i_size_read(realinode));
+       inode_set_iversion_raw(inode, inode_peek_iversion_raw(realinode));
 }

would've been sufficient.

Since overlayfs' does explicitly disallow changes to the upper and lower trees
while overlayfs is mounted it seems intuitive that it should just mirror the
relevant layer's i_version.

If we don't do this, then we should probably document that i_version doesn't
have a meaning yet for the inodes of stacking filesystems.

Sounds good to me.
