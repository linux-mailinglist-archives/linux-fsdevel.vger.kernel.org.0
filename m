The audit context needs to be set up for each event.  This happens in
audit_syslog_entry and audit_syslog_exit.

These are extra hooks to grab operation-specific (syscall) parameters.

Because syscall has been bypassed by a memory-mapped work queue.

This is by design to speed it up.  This is what Paul's iouring entry and
exit hooks do.
