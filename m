Fwiw, the TTM thing described upthread and in the other thread really
tries hard to work around the dma_buf == file lifetime choice by hooking
into the dma-buf specific release function so it can access the dmabuf
and then the file. All that seems like a pretty error prone thing to me.
So a separate refcount for dma_buf wouldn't be the worst as that would
allow that TTM thing to benefit and remove that nasty hacking into your
generic dma_buf ops. But maybe I'm the only one who sees it that way and
I'm certainly not familiar enough with dma-buf.
