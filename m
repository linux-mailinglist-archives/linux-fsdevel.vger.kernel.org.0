/me slaps his head and remembers that fsopen/fsconfig/fsmount exist.
Can you pass an fsopen fd to an unprivileged process and have that
second process call fsmount?

If so, then it would be more convenient if mount.safe/systemd-mountfsd
could pass open fds for /dev/fuse fsopen then the fuse server wouldn't
need any special /dev access at all.  I think then the fuse server's
service could have:

DynamicUser=true
ProtectSystem=true
ProtectHome=true
PrivateTmp=true
PrivateDevices=true
DevicePolicy=strict

(I think most of those are redundant with DynamicUser=true but a lot of
my systemd-fu is paged out ATM.)

My goal here is extreme containment -- the code doing the fs metadata
parsing has no privileges, no write access except to the fds it was
given, no network access, and no ability to read anything outside the
root filesystem.  Then I can get back to writing buffer
overflows^W^Whigh quality filesystem code in peace.

Yeah, that is a new risk.  It's still better than metadata parsing
within the kernel address space ... though who knows how thoroughly fuse
has been fuzzed by syzbot :P

Please do share, #f is my crazy unbaked idea. :)

I suppose mount.safe could very well call systemd-mount to go do all the
systemd-related service setup, and that would take care of udisks as
well.

That sounds similar to what I was thinking about, though there are a lot
of TLAs that I don't understand.
