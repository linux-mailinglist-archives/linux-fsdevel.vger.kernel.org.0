That would be one conclusion, another would be that timing is just
different and that triggers and issue. Or it could of course be a bug in
io_uring, perhaps a short write that gets retried or something like
that. I've run the tests for hours here and don't hit anything, I've
pulled in the for-next branch for btrfs and see if that'll make a
difference. I'll check your .config too.

Might not be a bad idea to have the writes contain known data, and when
you hit the failure to verify the csum, dump the data where the csum
says it's wrong and figure out at what offset, what content, etc it is?
If that can get correlated to the log of what happened, that might shed
some light on this.

OK, that rules out the multiple-writers theory.
