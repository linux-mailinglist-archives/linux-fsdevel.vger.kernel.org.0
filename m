When I saw the subject in my mailbox, I expected to see that you
would resurrect Christoph's updated text in [*1*], but you wrote a
whole lot more ;-) And they are quite informative to help readers to
understand what the option does.  I am not sure if the understanding
directly help readers to decide if it is appropriate for their own
repositories, though X-<.


Thanks.
