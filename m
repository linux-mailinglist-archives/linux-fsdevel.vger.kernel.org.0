Definitely better! Couple of suggestions:

Other "remote" clients, right? It's not limited to SMB, if the server
is also managing other protocols which might support flock'ing.

There's a subtlety here. If the server implements these SMB byte-range
locks in certain ways, the locks may interact with other protocols too.
So constraining the statement to "over SMB" may be incomplete.

Wy not simply say "this means that fcntl() and flock() locks interact
with one another", and preserve the generality?

Wait, the page just said that pre-5.5 was local only. Wouldn't it
be better to just say that "nobrl" turns off the entire behavior of
forwarding locks to the server, like before? Or are there other
side effects...
