Sorry I'm still a little confused.

The current block layer implementation causes that, as long as one split
bio fails, then the whole DIO fails, in which case several split bios
maybe have succeeded and the content has been written to the disk. This
is obviously what you called "partial IO completion".

I'm just concerned on how do you achieve that "DIO must return an error
without having issued any IO at all". Do you have some method of
reverting the content has already been written into the disk when a
partial error happened?
