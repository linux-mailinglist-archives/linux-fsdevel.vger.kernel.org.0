This might not help for Joanne's case, but so far the lack of a
launder_folio in my fuse+iomap prototype hasn't hindered it at all.
From what I can tell it's ok to bounce EBUSY back to dio callers...

...but only because a retry will initiate another writeback so
eventually we can make some forward progress.  But it helps a lot that
fuse+iomap is handing the entire IO stack over to iomap.

What do you do in ->release_folio if writeback fails?  Redirty it and
return false?
