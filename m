I could be wrong, but I don't think any of this is necessary.  My
strict splice isn't intended to be any more stable than current splice
-- it's intended to complete more slowly and more informatively.  Now
maybe I'm wrong and the impleentation would be nasty, but I think that
the only bookkeeping needed is to arrange strict-splice to not
complete until the kernel is done with the source's page cache.  The
use of the source is refcounted already, and a bit of extra work might
be needed to track which strict-splice the reference came from, but
unless I've missed something, it's not crazy.

Looking at the current splice implementaiton, a splice that isn't
"strictly completed" is sort of represented by a struct pipe_buffer (I
think).  The actual implementation of strict-splice might consist of
separating pipe_buffer out from a pipe and adding an io_kiocb* and a
refcount to it.  Or maybe even just adding an io_kiocb* and making the
existing refcouting keep also track the io_kiocb*, but that might be
complicated.  This all boils down to tracking an actual splice all the
way through its lifecycle and not reporting it as done until it's all
the way done.  Anything else is icing on the cake, no?

There is absolutely no need to lock files or make page-cache pages
immutable or anything like that.

i think this is almost exactly what Jeremy and Stefan are asking for
re: notification when the system is done with a zero-copy send:

> What might be helpful in addition would be some kind of
notification that all pages are no longer used by the network
layer, IORING_OP_SENDMSG_ZC already supports such a notification,
maybe we can build something similar.
