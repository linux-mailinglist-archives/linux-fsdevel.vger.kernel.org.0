This is actually the question that I intended to raise here. I should
have probably make it explicit. 

Also thank you for pointing out the man page info, at very least this
patch would require updating it - or possibly that is a reason to shot
this patch completelly. I would love to ear more opinions ;)

I did not think about such use-case, thank you for pointing that out!
Even if it looks like quite a corner-case, it also looks like quite a
deal breaker to me. Again other opinions more then welcome! ;)

Please allow me a question: do you think that solving the contention
problem reported here inside the kernel is worthy? Or should we
encourage (or enforce) the user-space to always do EPOLL_CTL_DEL for
better scalability?

Thanks,

Paolo
