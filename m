Ok, we're on the same page then.

Yep, same page again.

Yes, sure it's the filesystems responsibility to persist it to disk or
not. What I tried to ask was that when a filesystem does persist
i_version to disk then would it be legal to mount it without
SB_I_VERSION (because ext2/ext3 did use to have that mount option)? If
it would then the filesystem would probably need to take care to leave
the i_version field in struct inode uninitialized to avoid confusion or
would that just work? (Mere curiosity, don't feel obligated to go into
detail here. I don't want to hog your time.)

Yep, same page again.
