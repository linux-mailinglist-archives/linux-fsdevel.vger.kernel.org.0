I have few doubts about allocation/postponing. Are you referring to
uring allocating memory for this case, similar to the way
"req->async_data" is managed for few other opcodes?
Or can it (i.e. larger cmd) remain a user-space pointer, and the
underlying driver fetches the command in.
If submission context changes (for sqo/io-wq case), uring seemed to
apply context-grabbing techniques to make that work.

Moved to v3 now.
nvme_user_io is 48 bytes, while nvme passthrough requires 72 or 80
bytes (passthru with 64 bit result).
The block_uring_cmd has 32 bytes of available space. If NVMe defines
its own "nvme_uring_cmd" (which can be used for nvme char interface)
that will buy some more space, but still won't be enough for passthru
command.

So I am looking at adding support for large-cmd in uring. And felt the
need to clear those doubts I mentioned above.


Thanks
