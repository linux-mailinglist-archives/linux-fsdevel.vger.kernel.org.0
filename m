When all mounts in the init mount namespace are unmounted and all
remaining processes killed we switch root back to the initrd, so that
even the root fs can be unmounted, and then we disassemble any backing
complex storage if there is, i.e. lvm, luks, raid, â€¦

Because the initrd is its own little root fs independent of the actual
root we can fully disassemble everything this way, as we do not retain
any references to it anymore in any way.
