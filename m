Which architectures are supported by RoL at this point?

I can't speak for kmo, but bcachefs is new(ish) to the kernel, and
restricting support to the five major 64-bit arches (x64, arm64, ppc64,
s390x, riscv64) might be quite a load off him and his team.

Just speaking for myself, where xfs gets occasional weird bug reports of
strange behavior on platforms that none of us can test (csky) or OOM
reports with multi-TB filesystems on m68k.

Personally, I suspect that converting the existing big-glob-of-C fs
implementations is going to be a long slow task of rewriting the C code
piece by testable piece, starting with the outer rings and moving in
towards the core.  Until the core is done, there's probably going to be
a lot of FFI'ing going on.

I think that's what Kent is getting at when he talks about rewriting
online fsck before moving on to the guts of bcachefs.  Or at least,
that's the approach I would take if I were to start converting XFS.

Messing around with core structures like xfs_inode and xfs_mount will
come muuuuch later.

Is the ultimate goal of the RoL project to build Rust wrappers around
the C filesystem objects?  Or to design something more Rustic(?) and
present the interfaces that the VFS wants to the VFS only as needed?

I might be talking nonsense here, I've only started learning Rust.  But
I /can/ speculate about what a Rust fs will need based on all the stuff
I've learned over the past 20y of wrangling the C filesystems.

Honestly, these three patches seem to me like the barest stub to be able
to plant a flag and say "Hey look, Rust in a merged linux fs driver!"
Even if the only progress anyone makes on that this year is to wrap the
bcachefs btree iterators in Rust and reimplement a bunch of ioctls.
