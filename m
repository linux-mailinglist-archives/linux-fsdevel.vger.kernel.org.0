The idea is to be able to verify anything that is accessed, as soon as
rootfs is available, without distinction between embedded or external
initial ram disk.

Also, requiring an embedded initramfs for xattrs would be an issue for
systems that use it for other purposes.

No, because /init can potentially compromise the integrity of the
system.

As I wrote above, signing the CPIO image would be more secure, if this
option is available. However, a disadvantage would be that you have to
sign the CPIO image every time a file changes.

Requiring file metadata to make decisions seems reasonable. Also
mandatory access controls do that. The objective of this patch set is to
have uniform behavior regardless of the filesystem used.

What do you mean exactly?

By signing the CPIO image, the kernel wouldn't even attempt to parse it,
as the image would be rejected by the boot loader if the signature is
invalid.

Appending just the signature would be possible. It won't work if you
have multiple metadata for the same file.

Also appending the signature alone won't solve the parsing issue. Still,
the kernel has to parse something that could be malformed.
