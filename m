I'm not reading whole of this thread, so I can be pointless though. I
can't recall the discussion of exfat with you. My history about exfat
is,

   write read-only exfat from on-disk data -> MS published patent to
   their site or such -> stopped about exfat -> recently looks like MS
   changed mind

Well, if you are going to developing actively, IMO it would be better to
drop historically bad decisions in fat driver (some stuff would be hard
to fix without user visible changes), and re-think from basic
implementation design.

And I can't recall the detail of exfat format though, IIRC, the common
code is not so big, but some stuff can be shared with fat (timestamp
stuff, fatent stuff, IIRC). So IMO it is better to be different driver
basically, however on other hand, it is better to share the code for
same on-disk format if possible.

Anyway, I don't have strong opinion about it.

Thanks.
