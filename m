thank you!

I can add in some more results and probably need to redo at least the
metadata tests. I have all the results in google docs and in plain text
files, just a bit cumbersome maybe also spam to post all of it here.

I think the DIO use case is declining. My fuse work is now related to
the DDN Infina project, which has a DLM - this will all go via cache and
notifications (into from/to client/server) I need to start to work on
that asap... I'm also not too happy yet about cached writes/reads - need
to find time to investigate where the limit is.

Yeah, I had seen it. Just checking again, interesting is actually their
instrumentation branch

https://github.com/sbu-fsl/fuse-kernel-instrumentation

This should be very useful upstream, in combination with Josefs fuse
tracepoints (btw, thanks for the tracepoint patch Josef! I'm going to
look at it and test it tomorrow).

As written above, I can add a few more data. But if possible I wouldn't
like to concentrate on benchmarking - this can be super time consuming
and doesn't help unless one investigates what is actually limiting
performance. Right now we see that io-uring helps, fixing the other
limits is then the next step, imho.

Yeah, it creates files, I think on xfs (or ext4). I had tried tmpfs
first, but it had issues with seekdir/telldir until recently - will
switch back to tmpfs for next tests.

> In how many directories?

> with >=8 threads?

I don't think the directory inode lock is an issue - this should be one
(or more directories) per thread

Basically

/usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/mpirun \
            --mca btl self -n $i --oversubscribe \
            ./mdtest -F -n40000 -i1 \
                -d /scratch/dest -u -b2 | tee ${fname}-$i.out


(mdtest is really convenient for meta operations, although requires mpi,
recent versions are here (the initial LLNL project merged with ior).

https://github.com/hpc/ior

"-F"
Perform test on files only (no directories).

"-n" number_of_items
Every process will creat/stat/remove # directories and files

"-i" iterations
The number of iterations the test will run

"-u"
Create a unique working directory for each task

"-b" branching_factor
The branching factor of the hierarchical directory structure [default: 1].


(The older LLNL repo has a better mdtest README
https://github.com/LLNL/mdtest)


Also, regarding metadata, I definitely need to find time resume work on
atomic-open. Besides performance, there is another use case
https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/issues/945. Sweet Tea Dorminy / Josef
also seem to need that.
