Hi Dominique,

Ah, I misunderstood your question, sorry. The thing is f_count is 
init-ed to be 1,

and normal uring requests do fdget first, so I think it's ok for normal 
requests.

What Christian points out is issue with fixed file, that is indeed a 
problem I think.

Yes, like Al pointed out, getdents with an offset is not the right way 
to do it,

So a way to do seek is a must. But like what I said in the cover-letter, 
I do think the right thing is to

import lseek/llseek to io_uring, not increment the complex of getdents.


Thanks,

Hao
