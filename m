I do not think that kernel guarantee for any filesystem that rename
operation would be atomic on underlying disk storage.

But somebody else should confirm it.

So if kernel crashes in the middle of c or between c and d you need to
repair filesystem externally prior trying to boot from such disk.

Theoretically it could be possible to implement it for FAT (with more
restrictions), but I doubt that general purpose implementation of any
filesystem in kernel can do such thing. So no practically.

Those bootloader firmwares which just load & run bootloader practically
do not write anything to that FAT filesystem. In most cases their
implementation of FAT is read-only and very stupid. I doubt that there
is check for dirty flag.

I saw lot of commercial devices of different kind which can read & write
(backup) data to (FAT) SD card. And lot of time they were not able to
read FAT filesystem formatted by other tool, only by their (or by
in-device FAT formatted).

So such firmwares can be full of bugs and it really is not a good idea
to try booting bootloader from inconsistent FAT filesystem.

fs_passno set to 2 should be fine. You need to set it to 1 only for root
device, on which is running linux system. All other disks which are not
needed for running linux system can have fs_passno set to 2.

This depends on grub's FAT implementation. As said I would be very
careful about such "atomic" writes. There are also some caches, include
hardware on-disk, etc...

Yes, UEFI API allows you to write to disk devices. And UEFI fileystem
implementation can also supports writing to FAT fs.

Bad implementation would ignore it. This is something which you should
expect.

The best is to always have fragile filesystem in consistent state. And
if it goes broken, repair it on external system prior trying to write to
it by some untrusted/broken/bad filesystem driver. This would prevent
data damage.
