Hi all,

I didn't forgot about this remaining issue and I have kept thinking
about it on and off.

I did try the following on 5.12.19:

diff --git a/fs/coredump.c b/fs/coredump.c
index 07afb5ddb1c4..614fe7a54c1a 100644

 	if (retval < 0)
 		goto fail_creds;
-- 
2.32.0

with my current understanding, io_uring_files_cancel is supposed to
cancel everything that might set the TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL.

I must report that in my testing with generating a core dump through a
pipe with the modif above, I still get truncated core dumps.

systemd is having a weird error:
[ 2577.870742] systemd-coredump[4056]: Failed to get COMM: No such
process

and nothing is captured

so I have replaced it with a very simple shell:
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern 
|/home/lano1106/bin/pipe_core.sh %e %p

~/bin $ cat pipe_core.sh 
#!/bin/sh

cat > /home/lano1106/core/core.$1.$2

BFD: warning: /home/lano1106/core/core.test.10886 is truncated:
expected core file size >= 24129536, found: 61440

I conclude from my attempt that maybe io_uring_files_cancel is not 100%
cleaning everything that it should clean.
