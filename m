Is this even a real problem? The network stack doesn't care at
all if you modify the pages while it's being processed.  All the
things you've mentioned (checksum, encryption, etc.) will be
self-consistent on the wire.

Even when actual hardware offload is involved it's hard to see how
things could possibly go wrong unless the hardware was going out of
its way to do the wrong thing by fetching from memory twice.

Cheers,
