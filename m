Thanks for pointing this out.  In the case of Landlock, walking to a
disconnected mount point (because of this umount race condition) would
deny the requested access whereas it may be allowed otherwise.  This is
not a security issue but still an issue because an event unrelated to
the request (umount) can abort a path resolution, which should not be
the case.

Without access to mount_lock, what would be the best way to fix this
Landlock issue while making it backportable?

choose_mountpoint() is currently private, but if we add a new filesystem
helper, I think the right approach would be to expose follow_dotdot(),
updating its arguments with public types.  This way the intermediates
mount points will not be exposed, RCU optimization will be leveraged,
and usage of this new helper will be simplified.

Passing the root to a public follow_dotdot() helper should do the job.
