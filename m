We're only going to pass a struct if there really is a need for one
though. Meaning, we're shouldn't end up passing a struct with a single
element around in the hopes that we'll add more members at some point.

I'm not convinced that abusing current/task_struct for this is sane. I
not just very much doubt this will go down well with reviewers outside
of fs/ we'd also rightly be told that we're punting on a design problem
because it would be more churn.
