Yeah, this is pretty straight forward to do in XFS, I think. We were
talking about it on #xfs yesterday afternoon, and it all we really
need to do is this:

1. remove SB_I_VERSION from the superblock.

	Now nothing external to the filesystem will access
	inode->i_version  - it's value is undefined for external
	access and cannot be used for any purpose except filesystem
	internal information.

2. Set sb->s_time_gran to a power of 2 between 2^10 and 2^20 (TBD).

	This now gives the timestamp granularity that we expose to
	the VFS and userspace of 1us to 1ms. It gives us the lower
	10-20 bits for the persistent timestamp change counter to be
	encoded into for on-disk storage and change attribute
	cookies.

	Using the s_time_gran field like this with an external
	change counter means nothing in the VFS is aware that we
	store more information in the timestamp fields on disk.
	Everything should just work as it currently does (e.g.
	timestamp comparisons).

	It also means userspace never sees this internal change
	counter and so all the problems with incremental changes to
	timestamps within a timer tick across multiple files (i.e.
	the mgts problem) don't occur with this setup.

3. Every time the timestamp is touched and the timestamp doesn't
change, we bump inode->i_version. If the timestamp changes, then we
zero inode->i_version.

	THis gives us a per-coarse-timer-tick change counter. When
	the timestamp itself changes, we reset the change counter
	because the high bits in the timestamp have changed and that
	prevents the change coutner from wrapping arbitrarily and
	any on-disk timestamp from going backwards due to change
	counter overflow.

4. When statx asks for the change attribute, we copy the timestamp
into it and fold in the current change counter value.

	This provides the uniqueness that is required for the change
	counter.

5. When-ever the inode is persisted, the timestamp is copied to the
on-disk structure and the current change counter is folded in.

	This means the on-disk structure always contains the latest
	change attribute that has been persisted, just like we
	currently do with i_version now.

6. When-ever we read the inode off disk, we split the change counter
from the timestamp and update the appropriate internal structures
with this information.

	This ensures that the VFS and userspace never see the change
	counter implementation in the inode timestamps.

7. We need to be able to override inode_needs_update_time()
behaviour, as it will skip timestamp updates if timestamps are
equal.

	When timestamps are equal in this case, we need to bump the
	change counter rather than "do nothing". Hence we need
	different logic here, or a new method to be provided so the
	filesystem can decide how/when timestamps get updated.


This last piece of the puzzle is the problematic one.

Ideally, I'd like to see the ->update_time() code path be inverted.
Instead of only being called at the bottom once the VFS has decided
what timestamps need to be changed, it gets called directly from the
high level timestamp modification code and uses VFS helpers to
determine if updates are needed. 

e.g. the current code flow for an atime update is:

touch_atime()
  atime_needs_update()
  <freeze/write protection>
  inode_update_time(S_ATIME)
    ->update_time(S_ATIME)
      <filesystem atime update>

I'd much prefer this to be:

touch_atime()
  if (->update_time(S_ATIME)) {
    ->update_time(S_ATIME)
      xfs_inode_update_time(S_ATIME)
        if (atime_needs_update())
	  <filesystem atime update>
  } else {
    /* run the existing code */
  }

Similarly we'd turn file_modified()/file_update_time() inside out,
and this then allows the filesystem to add custom timestamp update
checks alongside the VFS timestamp update checks.

It would also enable us to untangle the mess that is lazytime, where
we have to implement ->update_time to catch lazytime updates and
punt them back to generic_update_time(), which then has to check for
lazytime again to determine how to dirty and queue the inode.
Of course, generic_update_time() also does timespec_equal checks on
timestamps to determine if times should be updated, and so we'd
probably need overrides on that, too.

Sorting the lazytime mess for internal change counters really needs
for all the timestamp updates to be handled in the filesystem, not
bounced back and forward between the filesystem and VFS helpers as
it currently is, hence I think we need to rework ->update_time to
make this all work cleanly.

-Dave.
