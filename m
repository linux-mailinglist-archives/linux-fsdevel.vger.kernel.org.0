Well, the generic ringbuffer would lift that restriction.

*nod*

That's the big question, put the data inline (with potential alignment
hassles) or manage (and map) a separate data structure.

Maybe padding could be inserted to solve alignment?

A separate data structure would only really be useful if it enabled zero
copy, but that should probably be a secondary enhancement.

DDN - lustre related?
