The problem where we're dealing with 64 bit inode numbers even on 32 bit
systems is one problem and porting struct inode to use a 64 bit type for
i_ino is a good thing that I agree we should explore.

I'm still not sure how that would stolve the audit problem though. The
inode numbers that audit reports, even if always 64 bit, are not unique
with e.g., btrfs and bcachefs. Audit would need to report additional
information for both filesystems like the subvolume number which would
make this consistent.

We should port to 64 bit and yes that'll take some time. Then audit may
want to grow support to report additional information such as the
subvolume number. And that can be done in various ways without having to
burden struct inode_operations with any of this. Or, document the 20
year reality that audit inode numbers aren't unique on some filesystems.
