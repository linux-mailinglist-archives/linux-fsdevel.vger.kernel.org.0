And that's fine, for requests where it matters, on-the-side
discoverability can still be a thing. If we're in the task itself where
it is queued, that provides us safey from the work going way from under
us. Then we just have to mark it appropriately, if it needs to get
canceled instead of run to completion.

Some care needed, of course, but there's nothing that would prevent this
from working. Ideally we'd be able to peal off a task_work entry, but
that's kind of difficult with the singly linked non-locked list.
