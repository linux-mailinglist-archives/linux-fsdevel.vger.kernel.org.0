Because apparently no one has tried it.  It should be possible in theory,
but for example unless you have power of 2 reclaim unit size size it
won't work very well with XFS where the AGs/RTGs must be power of two
aligned in the LBA space, except by overprovisioning the LBA space vs
the capacity actually used.

Please always mentioned what layer you are talking about.  At the syscall
level the temperatur hints are doing quite ok.  A full stream separation
would obviously be a lot better, as would be communicating the zone /
reclaim unit / etc size.

As an interface to a driver that doesn't natively speak temperature
hint on the other hand it doesn't work at all.

Well, the previous round was the first one actually trying to address the
fundamental issue after 4 month.  And then after a first round of feedback
it gets shutdown somehow out of nowhere.  As a maintainer and review that
is the kinda of contributors I have a hard time taking serious.
