Yeah, I really wish it did.  I particularly wish that it had a way to
negotiate all the FUSE_INIT stuff before libfuse daemonizes and starts
up the event loop.  Well, not all of it -- by the time we get to
FUSE_INIT we've basically decided to commit to mounting.

For fuseblk servers this is horrible, because the kernel needs to be
able to open the block device with O_EXCL during the mount() process,
which means you actually have to be able to (re)open the block device
from op_init, which can fail.  Unless there's a way to drop O_EXCL from
an open fd?

The awful way that I handle failure in FUSE_INIT is to call
fuse_session_exit, but that grossly leaves a dead mount in its place.

Hey wait, is this what Mikulas was talking about when he mentioned
synchronous initialization?

For iomap I created a discovery ioctl so that you can open /dev/fuse and
ask the kernel about the iomap functionality that it supports, and you
can exit(1) without creating a fuse session.  The one goofy problem with
that is that there's a TOCTOU race if someone else does echo N >
/sys/module/fuse/parameters/enable_iomap, though fuse4fs can always
fall back to non-iomap mode.
