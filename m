What are the requirements regarding the order of audit_names in
the ->names_list?  I really don't like the idea of having struct filename
tied to audit_context - io_uring is not the only context where it might
make sense to treat struct filename as first-class citizens.

And having everything that passed through getname()/getname_kernel()
shoved into ->names_list leads to very odd behaviour, especially with
audit_names conversions in audit_inode()/audit_inode_child().

Look at the handling of AUDIT_DEV{MAJOR,MINOR} or AUDIT_OBJ_{UID,GID}
or AUDIT_COMPARE_..._TO_OBJ; should they really apply to audit_names
resulting from copying the symlink body into the kernel?  And if they
should be applied to audit_names instance that had never been associated
with any inode, should that depend upon the string in those being
equal to another argument of the same syscall?

I'm going through the kernel/auditsc.c right now, but it's more of
a "document what it does" - I don't have the specs and I certainly
don't remember such details.
