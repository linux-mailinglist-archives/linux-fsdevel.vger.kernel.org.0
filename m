Ask yourself, why would schedule() return immediately rather than
actually block? There's a few cases here:

1) The task state is set to TASK_RUNNING - either because it was never
   set to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE/TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, or because someone
   raced and woke up the task after the initial check on whether it
   should be sleeping or not.

2) Some kind of notification or signal is pending. This is usually when
   task_sigpending() returns true, or if TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL is set. Those
   need clearing, and that's generally done on return to userspace.

#1 isn't the case here, but #2 looks highly plausible. The io-wq workers
rely on running this kind of work manually, and retrying. If we loop
further down with these conditions being true, then we're just busy
looping at that point and will NEVER sleep. You don't see any functions
related to signal handling etc EXACTLY because of that, there's nowhere
it gets run.

It's set becase of what I outlined above. If schedule() would actually
sleep, then io_wq_worker_sleeping() would've been called. The fact that
you're getting io_wq_worker_running() called without WORKER_F_RUNNING
cleared is because of that.

But you're too focused on the symptom here, not the underlying issue. It
doesn't matter at all that io_wq_worker_running() is called when the
task is already running, it'll just ignore that. It's explicitly tested.
Your patch won't make a single difference for this case because of that,
you're just wrapping what's esssentially a no-op call with another no-op
call, as you've now nested RUNNING inside the FAULT flag. It won't
change your outcome at all.
