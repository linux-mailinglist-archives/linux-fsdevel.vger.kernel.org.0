Because that's what the man page says? :)

IIUC the man page doesn't need to update if we revert this patch.

The man page described clearly on what will happen if we pass in feature
bits that are not supported:

       To enable userfaultfd features the application should set a bit
       corresponding to each feature it wants to enable in the features
       field.  If the kernel supports all the requested features it will
       enable them.  Otherwise it will zero out the returned uffdio_api
       structure and return EINVAL.

I'll definitely copy you when I post it.  It growed a bit larger than I
thought, it'll be great if you can help have a look.

In the test cases I added an UFFDIO_API test to be the 1st one and that's
why I found this issue.  To let all tests pass currently I'll need to
revert this patch.  If you want we can move the discussion there when I
post it, I think that may need to be the 1st patch for the test suite
change and to let current test suite pass.

To tell the truth, if I'm going to change the API anyway, I'll simply add a
UFFDIO_FEATURES ioctl() returning the supported features, that'll be much,
much easier than either the old one or the one this patch proposed, IMHO.
Then we keep all the rest untouched.  That should work perfectly and
that'll not require open()/close() duplications either.

But as I mentioned before, I don't think UFFDIO_FEATURES justifies itself
either much on being worthwhile because it introduces a new ioctl without
any major benefit.  At least we'll need to keep the old behavior still
working.
