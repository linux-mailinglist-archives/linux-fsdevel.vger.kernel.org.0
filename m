Fwiw, I have pointed this out in one of my really early submission of
this work and had asked whether we generally want the same check. That's
also why I added the shadow-mount check into the automount path because
that could be used for that sort of issue to afair but my memory is
fuzzy here.

Yes.

I'm seeing you have already sent a second mail so I take it you made a
decision already but the second option seems sanest to me.
