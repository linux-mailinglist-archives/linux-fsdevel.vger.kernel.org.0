Speaking of which, is there anything in specs that would require -F obj_uid=0
to give a match on symlink("foo", "bar") done by non-root in non-root-owned
directory, but not on symlink("foo", "foo") in the same conditions?

Put it another way, could we possibly make the predicates that refer to inode
state *not* evaluate to true on audit_name instances that had never been
associated with any inodes?  Currently, symlink body has such an audit_name
instance, except when that instance had been picked by audit_inode_parent()
for conversion (or had been shared from the very beginning in case of symlink(2)
that had identical pointers passed in both arguments).

Al, carefully abstaining from any comments on the sanity of said specifications -
it's a government document, after all, so those should be obvious...
