It is just the sane implementation of Mikulas's static mapping
approach: no need to move to workqueue if the mapping is immutable
or sort of.

Also it matches with io_uring's FS read/write implementation:

- try to submit IO with NOWAIT first

- then fallback to io-wq in case of -EAGAIN

It isn't perfect, sometime it may be slower than running on io-wq
directly.

But is there any better way for covering everything?

I guess no, because FS can't tell us when the IO can be submitted
successfully via NOWAIT, and we can't know if it may succeed without
trying. And basically that is what the interface is designed.

Yes, that is why BLK_MQ_F_BLOCKING is added.

Right.

I saw that when I wrote ublk/zoned in which every write needs to
allocate space. It is workaround by preallocating space for one fixed
range or the whole zone.

But that can't be avoided without using NOWAIT, and read is blocked
when write(WAIT) is in-progress.

Yes, it will be slower, and io_uring FS IO application is in
the same situation, and usually application doesn't have such
knowledge if RWF_NOWAIT can succeed.

However, usually meta IO is much less compared with normal IO, so most
times it will be a win to try NOWAIT first.

It has been shown many times that AIO submitted from single or much less
contexts is much more efficient than running IO concurrently from multiple
contexts, especially for sequential IO.

Please see the recent example of zloop vs. ublk/zoned:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/d5e59531-c19b-4332-8f47-b380ab9678be@kernel.org/

When zloop takes single dispatcher just like the in-tree loop, sequential
WRITE performs much better than initial version of ublk/zoned, which just
handles every IO in its own io-wq(one time NOWAIT & -EAGAIN and one time fallback
to io-wq). I tried to submit FS WRITE via io-wq directly and it becomes what
your suggested, the improvement is small, and still much worse than zloop's
single dispatcher.

Later, when I switch to pre-allocate space for each zone or one fixed range,
each write is submitted with NOWAIT successfully, then the sequential write perf
is improved much:
