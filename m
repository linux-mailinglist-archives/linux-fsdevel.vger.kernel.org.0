I'm not fucking gate keeping anything, I'm really tired of this claim
with absolutely no facts backing it up.

How so?

What zoned interface to FDP?

The exposed interface is to:

 a) pick a write stream
 b) expose the size of the reclaim unit

not done yet, but needed for good operation:

 c) expose how much capacity in a reclaim unit has been written

This is about as good as it gets to map the FDP (and to a lesser extent
streams) interface to an abstract block layer API.  If you have a better
suggestion to actually expose these capabilities I'm all ears.

Now _my_ preferred use of that interface is a write out of place,
map LBA regions to physical reclaim blocks file system.  On the hand
hand because it actually fits the file system I'm writing, on the other
hand because industry experience has shown that this is a very good
fit to flash storage (even without any explicit placement).  If you
think that's all wrong that fine, despite claims to the contrary from
you absolutely nothing in the interface forced you to do that.

You can roll the dice for your LBA allocations and write them using
a secure random number generator.  The interface allows for all of that,
but I doubt your results will all that great.  Not my business.

Hey, feel free to come up with a better design.  The whole point of a
proper block layer design is that you actually can do that!

Because you apparently want an interface to FDP in the block layer.  And
if you want that you need to stop bypassing the file systems as pointed
out not just by me but also at least one other file system maintainer
and the maintainer of the most used block subsystem.  I've thrown you
some bones how that can be done while doing everything else you did
before (at least assuming you get the fs side past the fs maintainers),
but the only thanks for that is bullshit attacks at a personal level.
