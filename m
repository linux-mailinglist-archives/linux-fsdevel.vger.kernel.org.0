The only thing that is a bit unpleasant here is that this change
breaks the consistency between the creation helpers:

do_mkdirat()
do_symlinkat()
do_linkat()
do_mknodat()

All but of them currently take
const char __user *pathname
and call
user_path_create()
with that do_mkdirat() change that's no longer true. One of the major
benefits over the recent years in this code is naming and type consistency.
And since it's just matter of time until io_uring will also gain support
for do_{symlinkat,linkat,mknodat} I would think switching all of them to
take a struct filename
and then have all do_* helpers call getname() might just be nicer in the
long run.
