Yes, I'm actuely aware that for some flags having them FMODE_* bits
might be performance sensitive. Moving FMODE_PATH would probably be very
noticeable due to it's use in __fget_files_rcu() and there might be
other cases like FMODE_NOWAIT and so on.

So I was delibaretely moving flags that really remain static and that
are unlikely to be in a hot path. And we certainly need to be careful
about this.

I think in the long-run it can bring us benefits for new flag proposals
that we wouldn't be willing to accept if they had to live in FMODE_*
space. Either because they're a one-off (the MAP_SYNC flag comes to
mind) or because they're not performance sensitive and of course only if
they're static.

We should still push back on unnecessary FMODE_* bit additions but we
may be able to be a little less stingy with FOP_* bits for a bit.
