Sorry for delayed reply. This has fallen through the cracks...

Actually no. This condition is the one that gives any task a free pass
until dirty_freerun_ceiling(). So there's no need to do any modification
for that. Sorry, I've probably formulated my suggestion in a bit confusing
way.

Probably you wanted to say "are not affected by the throttling" in the
above.

I know that you're using fields in task_struct to propagate the delay info.
But IMHO that is unnecessary (although I don't care too much). Instead we
could factor out a variant of balance_dirty_pages() that returns 'pause' to
sleep, 0 if no sleeping needed. Normal balance_dirty_pages() would use this
for pause calculation, places wanting async throttling would only get the
pause to sleep. So e.g. iomap_write_iter() would then check and if returned
pause is > 0, it would abort the loop similary as we'd abort it for any
other reason when NOWAIT write is aborted because we need to sleep. Iouring
code then detects short write / EAGAIN and offloads the write to the
workqueue where normal balance_dirty_pages() can sleep as needed.

This will make sure dirty limits are properly observed and we don't need
that much special handling for it.
