Noo one is going to stop you from writing the code and posting it on the
list. But I think none of us here will be very eager to implement it. If
it can be done cleanly without performance regressions or unwiedly
complications in the generic lookup and permission checking code and
both posix acls and these nfs4 style acls can be abstracted away nicely
in a single file, and have well-defined semantics and there's a clear
use-case that isn't just someone's hobby project then it might be
considered. But it might also mean you've spent significant effort just
to hear a no in the end.
