Thanks, it looked good. It seems key differences (compared to
uring-patch that I posted) are -
1. using file-operation instead of block-dev operation.
2. repurpose the sqe memory for ioctl-cmd. If an application does
ioctl with <=40 bytes of cmd, it does not have to allocate ioctl-cmd.
That's nifty. We still need to support passing larger-cmd (e.g.
nvme-passthru ioctl takes 72 bytes) but that shouldn't get too
difficult I suppose.

And for some ioctls, driver may still need to use task-work to update
the user-space pointers (embedded in uring/ioctl cmd) during
completion.

@Jens - will it be fine if I start looking at plumbing nvme-part of
this series on top of your work?


Thanks,
