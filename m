Thanks for paying attention Amir. I think there is some validity to thinking
of famfs as Fuse for DAX. Administration / metadata originating in user space
is similar (but doing it this way also helps reduce RAS exposure to memory 
that might have a more complex connection path).

One way it differs from fuse is that famfs is very much aimed at use
cases that require performance. *Accessing* files must run at full
memory speeds.

I have a lot of thoughts here, and an actual conversation might be good
sooner rather than later. I hope to be at LSFMM to discuss this - if you agree,
put in a vote for my topic ;). But if you want to talk sooner than that, I'm
interested.

I think one piece of evidence that this isn't possible with Fuse today is that
I had to plumb the iomap interface for /dev/dax in this patch set. That is the
way that fs-dax file systems communicate with the dax layer for fault 
resolution. If fuse/virtiofs handles dax somehow without the iomap interface,
I suspect it's doing something somehow simpler, /and/ that might need to get 
reconciled with the fs-dax methodology. Or maybe I don't know what I'm talking
about (in which case, please help :D).

I think one thing that might make sense would be to bring up this functionality
as a standalone file system, and then consider merging it into fuse when &
if the time seems right. 

Famfs doesn't currently have any up-calls. User space plays the log and tells
the kmod to instantiate files with extent lists to dax. Access happens with
zero user space involvement.

The important thing, the thing I'm currently paid for, is making it
practical to use disaggregated shared memory - it's ultimately not important 
which mechanism is used to enable a filesystem access method for memory.

But caching metadata in the kernel for efficient fault handling is the
only way to get it to perform at "memory speeds" so that appears critical.

One final observation: famfs has significantly more code in user space than
in kernel space, and it's the user side that is likely to grow over time.
That logic is at least theoretically independent of the kernel ABI.
