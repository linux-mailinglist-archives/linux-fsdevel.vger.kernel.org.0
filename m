Hi Eric,

What is stopping the task calling do_coredump() to be interrupted and
call task_work_add() from the interrupt context?

This is precisely what I was experiencing last summer when I did work
on this issue.

My understanding of how async I/O works with io_uring is that the task
is added to a wait queue without being put to sleep and when the
io_uring callback is called from the interrupt context, task_work_add()
is called so that the next time io_uring syscall is invoked, pending
work is processed to complete the I/O.

So if:

1. io_uring request is initiated AND the task is in a wait queue
2. do_coredump() is called before the I/O is completed

IMHO, this is how you end up having task_work_add() called while the
coredump is generated.

So far, the only way that I have found making sure that this was not
happening was to cancel every pending io_uring requests before writing
the coredump by calling io_uring_task_cancel():
