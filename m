That's another solution.  Since the initial (na√Øfe) idea of having a
client-only implementation with fscrypt-agnostic MDSs is long gone, the
design can (still) be fixed to do that.  This will definitely allow to
move forward with the fscrypt implementation.  (But we'll probably be
bitten again with these recursive RPCs in the future!)

Anyway, this is probably the most interesting solution as it also reduces
the need for extra calls to MDS.  And the fscrypt bool in inodestat
probably becomes redundant and can be dropped.
