>>> Given that CXL memory devices can potentially cover a wide range of technologies with quite different latency and bandwidth metrics, will one zone serve as the management vehicle that you seek? If a system contains both CXL attached DRAM and, let say, a byte-addressable CXL SSD - both used as (different) byte addressable tiers in a tiered memory hierarchy, allocating memory from the ZONE_EXMEM doesnât really tell you much about what you get. So the client would still need an orthogonal method to characterize the desired performance characteristics. This method could be combined with a fabric independent zone such as ZONE_PREFER_MOVABLE to address the kernel allocation issue. At the same time, this new zone could also be useful in other cases, such as virtio-mem.

Yes, especially a motivation for GFP_EXMEM and ZONE_EXMEM would be 
great. New GFP flags and zone are very likely a lot of upstream 
pushback. So we need a clear motivation and discussion of alternatives 
(and why this memory has to be treated so special but still wants to be 
managed by the buddy).

Willy raises some very good points.
