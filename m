I know the issue, but admittedly forgot about it here, thanks for
reminding! Considering that attempts to change the situation failed
some years ago and I haven't heard about it after, I don't think
it'll going to change any time soon.

So how about to follow what the block layer does and disable multi
bio nowait submissions for async IO?

if (!iocb_is_sync(iocb)) {
	if (multi_bio)
		return -EAGAIN;
	bio_opf |= REQ_NOWAIT;
}

Is there anything else but io_uring and AIO that can issue async
IO though this path?

By the end of the day, it's waiting for IO, the first and very thing
the user don't want to see for async IO, and that's pretty much what
makes AIO borderline unusable. We just can't have it for an asynchronous
interface. If we can't fix it up here, the only other option I see
is to push all such io_uring requests to a slow path where we can
block, and that'd be quite a large regression.
