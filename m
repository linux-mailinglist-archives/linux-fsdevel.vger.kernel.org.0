Thank you for shepherding his first contribution.  Unfortunately, this
is rather the way of it when you start to pick at something ... you find
more things that are broken.  It's rather unusual that this one turned
out to be "The POSIX spec has a defect" ;-)

But yes, I'm content with v2 if v2 does in fact return ESPIPE for
readahead() on a socket.  Let's wait to find out.  We can address the
POSIX defect later.
