The main thing we want is that it's somewhat clear that it's special
purpose interface (Sometimes I jokingly feel we should have
include/linux/quirky_overlayfs_helpers.h or actually working module
specific exports so we can export a helper to only a single module.
Whatever happened to that?).

If you do the cred guard thing then maybe name it:

{override,revert}_cred_light()

and then use them to implement the replace portion for:

{override,revert}_cred().

Yes, the {override,revert}_cred() naming isn't optimal but unless we
rename them as well to *_{save,restore} I don't see the point in making
the new helpers deviate from that pattern. They basically do the same
thing.

So my point is to just let them mirror the naming in __fget_light().
To a regular VFS developer the *_light() will give away that it probably
doesn't take a reference.

But I'm not married to that.

So I'd probably just do something like the following COMPLETELY UNTESTED
AND UNCOMPILED thing:

Most likely they are. I don't see what else would be expensive. But I
may lack details.

Place a nice comment explaining lifetime expectations in the commit
message. Then someone can always tell us why we're wrong.
