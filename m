s/filename_lookup/getname_flags/, sorry.

Again, statx support does both the copyin and pathname resolution *after*
prep, from io_statx().  They are not separated - io_statx() pass the userland
pointer to user_path_at_empty(), which does all the work.  So if a pathname
you'd passed had been in a local array and you return right after submitting
a request, you will end up with io_statx() fetching random garbage.

This patchset is different - for getxattr you have getname done in prep,
with resulting struct filename kept around until the actual work is to
be done.  That's precisely the reason why the first patch in the series
introduces a user_path_at_empty() variant that takes a struct filename,
with the pathname contents already copied in.

IOW, why is user_path_at_empty() good for statx, but not for getxattr?
What's the difference?

Do you treat the pathname contents (string in userland memory, that is)
same way your writev support treats iovec array (caller may discard it
as soon as syscall returns) or the same way it treats the actual data
to be written (caller is responsible for keeping it around until the
operation reports completion)?
