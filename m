Yes, it's a stupid bug and slipped through accidentally, not proud of
it. And it's obvious to anyone that it shouldn't be touched after a
put, so have no clue why there is such a long explanation.
Anyway, thanks for letting know.

By luck, it should be of low severity, as it's a compatibility check,
the result of which is not depended upon by any code after. To
fault would need some RAM hot-remove (?). Not an excuse, how you
put it, but useful to notice.
