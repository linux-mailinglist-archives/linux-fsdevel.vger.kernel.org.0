I have been working with the patch set as it has evolved for quite a
while now.

I've been reading the kernel code quite a bit and forwarded questions
and minor changes to David as they arose.

As for a review, not specifically, but while the series implements a
rather large change it's surprisingly straight forward to read.

In the time I have been working with it I haven't noticed any problems
except for those few minor things that I reported to David early on (in
some cases accompanied by simple patches).

And more recently (obviously) I've been working with the mount
notifications changes and, from a readability POV, I find it's the
same as the fsinfo() code.

Maybe but the system call is fundamental to making notifications useful
and, as I say, after working with it for quite a while I don't fell
there's missing features (that David hasn't added along the way) and
have found it provides what's needed for what I'm doing (for mount
notifications at least).

I'll be posting a github PR for systemd for discussion soon while I
get on with completing the systemd change. Like overflow handling and
meson build system changes to allow building with and without the
util-linux libmount changes.

So, ideally, I'd like to see the series merged, we've been working on
it for quite a considerable time now.

Ian
