I don't understand that part. If overlayfs uses /sys/power/ as a lower
layer it can open and write to /sys/power/resume, no?

Honestly, why don't you just block /sys/power from appearing in any
layer in overlayfs? This seems like such a niche use-case that it's so
unlikely that this will be used that I would just try and kill it.

If you do it like Al suggested and switch it to an automount you get
that for free. But I guess you can also just block it without that.

(Frankly, I find it weird that sysfs is allowed as a layer in any case. I
completely forgot about this. Imho, both procfs and sysfs should not be
usable as a lower layer - procfs is, I know - and then only select parts
should be like /sys/fs/cgroup or sm where I can see the container people
somehow using this to mess with the cgroup tree or something.)
