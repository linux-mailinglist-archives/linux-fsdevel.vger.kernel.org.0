Hi,

adding linux-fsdevel@vger in Cc, there's more people who know about this
than me there

Sorry for the delay in replying, I just didn't take time to test until
now.
So the thing is given how the current 9p servers I know are implemented,
file IOs will be backed by a file which has been opened in O_APPEND and
the behaviour will transparently be correct for them; that's probably
why nobody ever caught up on this until now.


I think it makes sense however, so I'll take the patch unless someone
complains; please note that in case of concurrent accesses a client-side
implementation will not guarantee proper O_APPEND behaviour so it should
really be enforced by the server; because generic_file_llseek relies on
the size stored in the inode in cache (and it would be racy anyway if it
were to refresh attributes)

e.g. if two clients are opening the same file in O_APPEND and alternate
writing to it, they will just be overwriting each other on your server
implementation.


Well, generic_file_llseek has close to zero extra cost so it doesn't
cost much to include this safety, I'll just adjust the commit message to
warn of this pitfall and include the patch after some more testing.

Thanks,
