We tend to return EINVAL both for invalid (combination of) flags as well as
for flags applied to invalid objects in various calls. In practice there is
rarely a difference.

Well, EACCES translates to message "Permission denied" which as Christian
writes is justifiable but frankly I find it more confusing. Because when I
get "Permission denied", I go looking which permissions are wrong, perhaps
suspecting SELinux or other LSM and don't think that object type / location
is at fault.

I agree that with EINVAL it is impossible to distinguish "unsupported on
this object only" vs "completely unknown flag" but it doesn't seem like a
huge problem for userspace to me as I can think of workarounds even if
userspace wants to do something else than "report error and bail".
