The block portion is where this discussion started (in the context of
this thread's patchset, now at v7).

During our discussion I think there were 2 gaps identified with this
patchset:

1) provisioning should be opt-in, and we need a clear flag that upper
   layers look for to know if REQ_PROVISION available
   - we do get this with the max_provision_sectors = 0 default, is
     checking queue_limits (via queue_max_provision_sectors)
     sufficient for upper layers like xfs?

2) DM thinp needs REQ_PROVISION passdown support
   - also dm_table_supports_provision() needs to be stricter by
     requiring _all_ underlying devices support provisioning?

Bonus dm-thinp work: add ranged REQ_PROVISION support to reduce number
of calls (and bios) block core needs to pass to dm thinp.

Also Joe, for you proposed dm-thinp design where you distinquish
between "provision" and "reserve": Would it make sense for REQ_META
(e.g. all XFS metadata) with REQ_PROVISION to be treated as an
LBA-specific hard request?  Whereas REQ_PROVISION on its own provides
more freedom to just reserve the length of blocks? (e.g. for XFS
delalloc where LBA range is unknown, but dm-thinp can be asked to
reserve space to accomodate it).
