Hello Binder,

Thank you for sharing the data on which workloads
SLUB performs worse than SLAB. This information is critical for
improving SLUB and deprecating SLAB.

By the way, it appears that the spreadsheet is currently set to private.
Could you make it public for me to access?

I am really interested in performing similar experiments on my machines
to obtain comparable data that can be utilized to enhance SLUB.

Thanks,
Hyeonggon
