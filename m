yes, I agree.

Thank you, this is very helpful. And I have 2 concerns:

1.
In the current non-strictlimit logic, wb_thresh is only bumped within wb_position_ratio() for calculating pos_ratio, and this bump isnâ€™t restricted by max_ratio. 
Iâ€™m unsure if moving this adjustment to __wb_calc_thresh() would effect existing behavior. 
Would it be possible to keep the current logic for non-strictlimit case?

2. Regarding the formula:
wb_thresh = max(wb_thresh, (limit - dtc->dirty) / 8);

Consider a case: 
With 100 fuse devices(with high max_ratio) experiencing high writeback delays, the pages being written back are accounted in NR_WRITEBACK_TEMP, not dtc->dirty. 
As a result, the bumped wb_thresh may remain high. While individual devices are under control, the total could exceed expectations.

Although lowering the max_ratio can avoid this issue, how about reducing the bumped wb_thresh?

The formula in my patch:
wb_scale_thresh = (limit - dtc->dirty) / 100;
The intention is to use the default fuse max_ratio(1%) as the multiplier.


Thanks
Jim Zhao
