Not sure I understand why you think I don't know this, and why it
is a problem in any way?

<sigh>

We don't have encryption on XFS yet, so we'd completely ignore it.
It would never be set in the GET op, and it would be ignored on the
SET op.

chattr is not the interface for enabling encryption!

FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR returns various status information, and a subset
of that information can be used for changing inode state with
the FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR command.

The reason SET ignores stuff it can't set is because it expects that
GET->SET will result in flags being set that it can't actually
change, and so it ignores flags that cannot be set....

We've got a 13 or 14 free flag bits still remaining in fsx_xflags
before we need another flags field.

Because we have enough spare bits for all the new flags, yes?

Yes, new flags can have different behaviour. If we tell userspace
that we support windows attributes, we can define whatever behaviour
we want when setting -those new flag fields-.

Misunderstanding, I think.

"new chattr tool" implies a new implementation/binary, not modifying
the existing tools.

We will never be able to deprecate/remove deprecate the existing
ioctls.

xfsrestore has been using this interface for backup/restore
for about 25 years now. It only uses the SET function, because the
dump format stores all the flags from the dump side GET operation
natively.

i.e. xfsdump returns all the FS_XFLAGS that it supports in bulkstat
output so that xfsdump can avoid needing to call GET on every inode
it is going to back up.

So, yeah, we've been using this get/set xattr interface successfully
for backup for a long, long time.

That's an implementation problem, not an API issue.

I don't think such a static mask belongs in the GET/SET interface. If
overlay wants to know what features a filesytem supports so it can
find commonality, then the feature mask it should be calculated
once at mount time and not on every single operation...

I just don't see why we need -yet another- inode attribute userspace
API just to support a few new feature flags...
