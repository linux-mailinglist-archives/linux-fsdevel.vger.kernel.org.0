I tend to agree. 

Also, generally, this is not only problem of cpuset but some other
controllers well (the original letter mentions CPU bandwidth limits, another
thing are memory limits (and I wonder whether some apps already adjust their
behavior to available IO characteristics)).

The problem as I see it is the mapping from a real dedicated HW to a
cgroup restricted environment ("container"), which can be shared. In
this instance, the virtualized view would not be able to represent a
situation when a CPU is assigned non-exclusively to multiple cpusets.

(Although, one speciality of the CPU namespace approach here is the
remapping/scrambling of the CPU topology. Not sure if good or bad.)

For the reason above, I also agree with this. And I think this interface
(mostly) exists -- the userspace could query the cgroup files
(cpuset.cpus.effective in this case), they would even have the liberty
to decide between querying available resources in their "container"
(root cgroup (cgroup NS)) or further subdivision of that (the
immediately encompassing cgroup).

I'd like to write something in support of your approach but I'm afraid that the
problem of the mapping (dedicated vs shared) makes this most suitable for some
external/separate entity such as the LCXFS already.
