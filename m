fwiw, we've just recently had similar problems with io_uring read/write
and atime/mtime in prod environment, so we're interested in solving that
regardless of this patchset. I.e. io_uring issues rw with NOWAIT, {a,m}time
touch ignores that, that stalls other submissions and completely screws
latency.

It doesn't look (2) will solve it for reads/writes, at least without
the pain of changing the {write,read}_iter callbacks. 1) sounds good
to me from the io_uring perspective, but I guess it won't work
for mtime?
