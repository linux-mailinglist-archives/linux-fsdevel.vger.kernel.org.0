My main concern is two `private` naming here: I would like to add
`private` to iomap_read/readahead() much like __iomap_dio_rw() at
least to make our new feature work efficiently.

I said `per-request` meant a single sync read or readahead request,
which is triggered by vfs or mm for example.

Previously `.iomap_{begin,end}` participates in buffer read and write
I/O paths (except for page writeback of course) as you said, in
principle users only need to care about fields in `struct iomap_iter`.

`struct iomap_readpage_ctx` is currently used as an internal structure
which is completely invisible to filesystems (IOWs, filesystems don't
need to care or specify any of that).

After your proposal, new renamed `struct iomap_read_folio_ctx` will be
exposed to individual filesystems too, but that makes two external
context structures for the buffer I/O reads (`struct iomap_iter` and
`struct iomap_read_folio_ctx`) instead of one.

I'm not saying your proposal doesn't work, but:

  - which is unlike `struct iomap_writepage_ctx` because writeback path
    doesn't have `struct iomap_iter` involved, and it has only that
    exact one `struct iomap_writepage_ctx` context and all callbacks
    use that only;

  - take a look at `iomap_dio_rw` and `iomap_dio_ops`, I think it's
    somewhat similiar to the new `struct iomap_read_ops` in some
    extent, but dio currently also exposes the exact one context
    (`struct iomap_iter`) to users.

  - take a look at `iomap_write_ops`, it also exposes
    `struct iomap_iter` only. you may say `folio`, `pos`, `len` can be
    wrapped as another `struct iomap_write_ctx` if needed, but that is
    not designed to be exposed to be specfied by write_iter (e.g.
    fuse_cache_write_iter)

In short, traditionally the buffered read/write external context is
the only unique one `struct iomap_iter` (`struct iomap_readpage_ctx`
is only for iomap internal use), after your proposal there will be
two external contexts specified by users (.read_folio and .readahead)
but `.iomap_{begin,end}` is unable to get one of them, which is
unlike the current writeback and direct i/o paths (they uses one
external context too.)

Seperate into two contexts works for your use case, but it may
cause issues since future developers have to decide where to
place those new context fields for buffer I/O paths (
`struct iomap_iter` or `struct iomap_read_folio_ctx`), it's still
possible but may cause further churn on the codebase perspective.

That is my minor concern, but my main concern is still `private`
naming.

Gao Xiang
