I think we should allow FIONREAD if LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL is handled
and if LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE is explicitly allowed for this FD.

f->f_mode & FMODE_READ would make sense but it should have been handled
by the kernel; Landlock should not try to fix this inconsistency.

These are good test cases though.

It should be noted that SELinux considers FIONREAD as tied to metadata
reading (FILE__GETATTR). It think it makes more sense to tie it to the
read right (LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE) because it might be
(legitimately) required to properly read a file and FIONREAD is tied to
the content of a file, not file attributes.

Good point! The use case you define for writing is interesting. However,
would it make sense to seek at a specific offset without being able to
know/read the content? I guest not in theory, but in practice we might
want to avoid application to require LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE is
they only require to write (at a specific offset), or to deal with write
errors. Anyway, I guess that this information can be inferred by trying
to seek at a specific offset.  The only limitation that this approach
would bring is that it seems that we can seek into an FD even without
read nor write right, and there is no specific (LSM) access control for
this operation (and nobody seems to care about being able to read the
size of a symlink once opened). If this is correct, I think we should
indeed always allow FIOQSIZE. Being able to open a file requires
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ or WRITE anyway.  It would be interesting to
check and test with O_PATH though.

Before checking these commands, we first need to check that the original
domain handle LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL. We should try to pack this new
bit and replace the file's allowed_access field (see
landlock_add_fs_access_mask() and similar helpers in the network patch
series that does a similar thing but for ruleset's handle access
rights), but here is the idea:

if (!landlock_file_handles_ioctl(file))
	return 0;

We should check LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ instead, which is a superset of
FMODE_READ.
