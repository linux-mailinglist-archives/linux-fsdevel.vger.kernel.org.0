There is no problem in about how-to-do-it. That part is simple - we
have the iocb, and sync/async can be known whether ki_complete
callback is set.
This point to be discussed was whether-to-allow-short-write-or-not if
we are talking about a generic file-append-returning-location.

That said, since we are talking about moving to indirect-offset in
io-uring, short-write is not an issue anymore I suppose (it goes back
to how it was).
But the unsettled thing is -  whether we can use O/RWF_APPEND with
indirect-offset (pointer) scheme.

Maybe simple if we only think of ZoneFS (how user-space sends
async-append and gets result is a common problem).
Add Block I/O in scope -  it gets slightly more complicated because it
has to cater to non-zoned devices. And there already is a
well-established understanding that append does nothing...so  code
like "if (flags & IOCB_APPEND) { do something; }" in block I/O path
may surprise someone resuming after a hiatus.
Add File I/O in scope - It gets further complicated. I think it would
make sense to make it opt-in rather than compulsory, but most of them
already implement a behavior for IOCB_APPEND. How to make it opt-in
without new flags.

New flags (FMODE_SOME_NAME, IOCB_SOME_NAME) serve that purpose.
Please assess the need (for isolation) considering all three cases.
