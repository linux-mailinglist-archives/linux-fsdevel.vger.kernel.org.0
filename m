Is this necessary?  auditd and auditctl don't (intentionally) use any
io_uring functionality.  Is it possible it might inadvertantly use some
by virtue of libc or other library calls now or in the future?

While this seems like the most obvious approach given the parallels
between syscalls and io_uring operations, as coded here it won't work
due to the different mappings of syscall numbers and io_uring
operations unless we re-use the auditctl -S field with raw io_uring
operation numbers in the place of syscall numbers.  This should have
been obvious to me when I first looked at this patch.  It became obvious
when I started looking at the userspace auditctl.c.

The easy first step would be to use something like this:
	auditctl -a uring,always -S 18,28 -F key=uring_open
to monitor file open commands only.  The same is not yet possible for
the perm field, but there are so few io_uring ops at this point compared
with syscalls that it might be manageable.  The arch is irrelevant since
io_uring operation numbers are identical across all hardware as far as I
can tell.  Most of the rest of the fields should make sense if they do
for a syscall rule.  Here's a sample of userspace code to support this
patch:
	https://github.com/rgbriggs/audit-userspace/commit/a77baa1651b7ad841a220eb962d4cc92bc07dc96
	https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-userspace/compare/master...rgbriggs:ghau-iouring-filtering.v1.0


If we abuse the syscall infrastructure at first, we'd need a transition
plan to coordinate user and kernel switchover to seperate mechanisms for
the two to work together if the need should arise to have both syscall
and uring filters in the same rule.


I'm still exploring ideas on the best place to put this translation
table, in userspace libaudit, kaudit, io_op_defs[],
include/uapi/linux/io_uring.h, ...

For speed, the best would be in userspace libaudit, but that will be the
least obvious place for any io_uring developer to look when making any
updates to the list of io_uring operations and will most likely result
in additions escaping security logging.

Next best for speed would be in kaudit when instantiating rules, to
translate the syscall numbers to operation numbers and store them
natively in a different mask (audit_in_mask).  This also runs the risk
of additions escaping security logging.

After that, they could reuse the existing audit syscall filter
infrastructure and mask and translate on the fly from the specific op in
use to its equivalent syscall number when checking the existing filter.
This is the least disruptive to the audit code and the most likely to be
updated when new io_uring operations are added, but will incur an extra
step to translate the io_uring operation number to a syscall number in
the hot path.

Given that multiple aspects of security appear to have been a complete
afterthought to this feature, necessitating it to be bolted on after the
fact, it appears that the last option might be the most attractive to
the security folks, making this as easy as possible for fs folks to
update the audit code would be necessary to maintain security.


If there isn't a direct mapping between io_uring operations and
syscalls (the reverse isn't needed), then we'll need to duplicate the
mechanism throughout the stack starting in userspace auditctl and
libaudit.  Currently the bitmap for syscalls is 2k.  The current
io_uring op list appears to be 37.


It might be wise to deliberately not support auditctl "-w" (and the
exported audit_add_watch() function) since that is currently hardcoded
to the AUDIT_FILTER_EXIT list and is the old watch form [replaced by
audit_rule_fieldpair_data()] anyways that is more likely to be
deprecated.  It also appears to make sense not to support autrace (at
least initially).


Does any of this roughly make sense?
