I know, it really is a monster file at this point...

I've been pondering that for a while actually, and yes I agree it's time
to organize this a bit differently. When you are in this code all the
time you notice less as you know where everything is, but it would be
nice to take the time to split it into some manageable and separately
readable/maintainable pieces.

I was resistant to the indirect function call initially because of the
spectre overhead, but that was when the table was a lot smaller. The
tides may indeed have shifted on this now that the table has grown to
the size that it has. Plus we have both a prep handler and issue handler
for each, so you end up with two massive switches to deal with that.

As mentioned, it's something that I have myself been thinking about for
the past few releases. It's not difficult work and can be done in a
sequential kind of manner, but it will add some pain in terms of
backports. Nothing _really_ major, but... Longer term it'll be nicer for
sure, which is the most important bit.

I've got some ideas on how to split the core bits, and the
related-op-per file kind of idea for the rest makes sense. Eg net
related bits can go in one, or maybe we can even go finer grained and
(almost) do per-op.

I'll spend some time after the merge window to try and get this sorted
out.
