Oh, I did not spot the users here is the block device.  Which is really
weird, why would anyone do buffered writes to a block devices?  Doing
so is a bit of a data integrity nightmare.

Can we please develop this feature for iomap based file systems first,
and if by then a use case for block devices arises I'll see what we can
do there.  I've been planning to get the block device code to stop using
buffer_heads by default, but taking them into account if used by a
legacy buffer_head user anyway.
