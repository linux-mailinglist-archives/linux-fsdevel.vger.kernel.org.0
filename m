Note that we're also aware of the fact that calling bpf_d_path()
within an RCU read-side critical shouldn't be permitted. I have a
patch teed up which addresses this. bpf_path_d_path() OTOH isn't
susceptible to this problem as the BPF verifier ensure that BPF kfuncs
annotated KF_SLEEPABLE can't be called whilst in an RCU read-side
critical section.
