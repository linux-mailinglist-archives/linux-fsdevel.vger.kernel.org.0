Having written code to create additional worker threads in addition
to using io_uring as a main loop, I'm glad to see this proposal back
again.  I think the original work was shot down much too hastily based
on the file positioning issues.  Really only two cases of directory
position are useful*, which can be expressed either as an off_t
(0 = rewind, -1 = curpos), or a single bit flag.  As I understand the
code, the rewind case shouldn't be any problem.  From a practical
viewpoint, I don't think non-blocking would see a lot of use, but it
wouldn't hurt.

This also seems like a good place to bring up a point I made with
the last attempt at this code.  You're missing an optimization here.
getdents knows whether it is returning a buffer because the next entry
won't fit versus because there are no more entries.  As it doesn't
return that information, callers must always keep calling it back
until EOF.  This means a completely unnecessary call is made for
every open directory.  In other words, for a directory scan where
the buffers are large enough to not overflow, that literally twice
as many calls are made to getdents as necessary.  As io_uring is
in-kernel, it could use an internal interface to getdents which would
return an EOF indicator along with the (probably non-empty) buffer.
io_uring would then return that flag with the CQE.


(* As an aside, the only place I've ever seen a non-zero lseek on a
directory, is in a very resource limited environment, e.g. too small
open files limit.  In the case of a depth-first directory scan, it
must close directories before completely reading them, and reopen /
lseek to their previous position in order to continue.  This scenario
is certainly not worth bothering with for io_uring.)
