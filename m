Heh, this is also what I thought after reading. :)

If we see in the very early commit from Andrea it seems that would not hang
gup but just sigbus-ing it (see the comment that's mostly exactly the thing
Dimitris hit here):

commit 86039bd3b4e6a1129318cbfed4e0a6e001656635
Author: Andrea Arcangeli <aarcange@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 4 15:46:31 2015 -0700

    userfaultfd: add new syscall to provide memory externalization

+	/*
+	 * If it's already released don't get it. This avoids to loop
+	 * in __get_user_pages if userfaultfd_release waits on the
+	 * caller of handle_userfault to release the mmap_sem.
+	 */
+	if (unlikely(ACCESS_ONCE(ctx->released)))
+		return VM_FAULT_SIGBUS;
+

Then we switched over to the friendly way, assuming CRIU could close() the
uffd during the monitee process running, in:

commit 656710a60e3693911bee3a355d2f2bbae3faba33
Author: Andrea Arcangeli <aarcange@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 8 16:12:42 2017 -0700

    userfaultfd: non-cooperative: closing the uffd without triggering SIGBUS

I had a feeling that after that we didn't test gup (I assume normal page
fault path will still work).  Let me copy Mike too for that just in case he
has anything to say.  Paste thread again:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/79375b71-db2e-3e66-346b-254c90d915e2@cslab.ece.ntua.gr/T/#u

My understanding is that releasing mmap lock here should work, but we need
to move the code a bit.  Dimitris, please feel free to try the patch
attached here if you want.  It's probably not a major use case of uffd over
kvm (IIUC unregister before close() will also work?), but if it's trivial
to fix we should proably fix it.

Thanks,
