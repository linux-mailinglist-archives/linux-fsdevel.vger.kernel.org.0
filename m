Thank you for your review, which made me glad I sent out the patch early
as an RFC.  I (think I) understand the issues you pointed out and,
although some of them could be fixed (the races), I guess there's no point
pursuing this any further, since you consider the concept itself to be
broken.  Again, thank you for your time.

Cheers,
