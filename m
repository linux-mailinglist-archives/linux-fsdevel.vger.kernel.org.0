io_kiocb is:
        /* size: 232, cachelines: 4, members: 19 */
        /* forced alignments: 1 */
        /* last cacheline: 40 bytes */
so we have another 24 bytes before io_kiocb takes up another cacheline.
If that's a serious problem, I have an idea about how to shrink struct
kiocb by 8 bytes so struct io_rw would have space to store another
pointer.

... we've just done an I/O.  Concern about an extra pointer access
seems misplaced?

But userspace has to _do_ something with that information anyway.  So
it must already have somewhere to put that information.

I do think that interpretation of that field should be a separate flag
from WRITE_APPEND so apps which genuinely don't care about where the I/O
ended up don't have to allocate some temporary storage.  eg a logging
application which just needs to know that it managed to append to the
end of the log and doesn't need to do anything if it's successful.
