Hi,

I tested this patch series and I confirm that it fixes the issue for
Landlock.  Tingmao explained that it also fixes other subsystems such as
fanotify, and 9p itself.  I sent a patch to test this fix with Landlock
and I'll merge it once 9p is fixed:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250704171345.1393451-1-mic@digikod.net/

Could you please give it a try in linux-next and consider it for the
next merge window?

Regards,
 MickaÃ«l
