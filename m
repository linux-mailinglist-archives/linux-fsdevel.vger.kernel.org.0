Hi Ritesh,

THe docs look mostly good. I'll add some feedback below:

Should we add a line like:

Atomic write max unit is capped to the max supported by the underlying
device, incase it is less than the clustersize.

Also, maybe we can have a line wiht something like "With bigalloc's
clustered allocation we can be sure that an atomic write will always
be allocated aligned blocks. The only thing we need to ensure is that
we have a continuous mapping in the write rang."

Are the above 4 points needed explicitly? Maybe we can have:

Append writes, and writes on regions that are fully mapped,
unwritten or hole follow the same flow as non atomic writes.

Maybe:

... single continuous mapped extents by writing zeroes to it 

So that we explicitly mention what we are doing and not rely on people
knowing the meaning of EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_ZERO flag.
