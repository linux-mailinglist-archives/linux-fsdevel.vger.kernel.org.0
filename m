Sorry as you could see my key bindings got all messed up while trying to
delete this above line using "dd" and the mail got sent while trying to
fix it up. :(

However the previous email still has the same gist of what I wanted to
add. Please let me know your thoughts on using the section configs
approach for centralizing the filesystems configs.

I also wanted to add the reason for this work. Most of the wrappers if
we see anyways define extra configs for their testing e.g.

1. https://github.com/tytso/xfstests-bld/tree/master/test-appliance/files/root/fs
2. https://github.com/avocado-framework-tests/avocado-misc-tests/tree/master/fs/xfstests.py.data/ext4
3. https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/tree/4bffd17ac6a3ac757a26897a75ffa185d623a8e4/playbooks/roles/fstests/templates


We believe it would be easier if the default filesystem configs which
are of interest to FS maintainers, were added directly to the xfstests
repo. Additionally, it would also help if fstests could provide a way to
invoke these different configs/sections for testing without requiring
them to be redefined or copied in the local.config file each time.

Thanks
