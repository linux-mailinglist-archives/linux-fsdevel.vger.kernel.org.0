Thank you very much for your suggestion, and I'm sorry for the delayed reply
as last month I was exceptionally busy. 

Upon further consideration, I agree that adding entries to the existing memory.stat
interface is indeed preferable to arbitrarily creating new interfaces.  Therefore, my
next step is to plan adding the following global KSM metrics to memory.stat,  such as
ksm_merged, ksm_unmergable, ksm_zero, and ksm_profit. (These represent the
total amount of merged pages, unmergable pages, zero pages merged by KSM, and
the overall profit, respectively.) However, please note that ksm_merging_pages and
ksm_unshared need to be converted to be represented in bytes.‚Äù
