..... except when they are completely wrong. FS_IOC_[GS]ETXATTR was
promoted from XFs to the VFS to enable ext4 to use the existing
project ID and quota infrastructure (e.g. for testing with fstests).

You keep saying "it can be useful" without actually giving an
example of when it will be a significant improvement. Then you
demand proof that it isn't useful to userspace to justify a NACK.
That's not the way development works - you want the functionality,
you have to prove to that it is a significant improvement, not
demand that people prove that it isn't.

As it is, a lot of the "masks won't work" reasoning is in the
response I jsut wrote to Ted's email.  There appears to be a
significant lack of knowledge of the scope of the GET/SETXATTR
interfaces and how we've been using them for the past 20+ years
amongst the people arguing they should be fundamentally changed
right now.

You didn't get silence - I only work 3 days a week and I'm
explicitly not responding to upstream devel list email outside of
work hours. So it may take several days before I find time to
respond to any given discussion thread.

As I've told you many, many times before, Amir: slow down and have
patience. There is no rush, nor is there a need to force the
discussion to a rapid conclusion.

Doesn't work for xfsdump/restore use case.

Firstly, there's no space in the dump media format for extended
xflags (i.e. requires new code and backwards incompatible media dump
formats to be created).

Secondly, if the destination kernel and/or filesystem does not
support the flags mask or features defined in the flags mask, what
do we do then?  The policy decision made a couple of decades ago was
that it is better for the kernel to ignore file attrs it doesn't
understand on restore and let the restore continue than it is to
abort the restore....

Better to restore what we support than not be able to restore
anything, yes?

Except that it's completely undesireable behaviour for the existing
dump/restore usage of this interface.

If we just add the windows attributes to the fsx_flags field as
I have suggested, then xfsdump/xfs_restore would natively supports
backing up and restoring windows attributes on XFS files the moment
that the kernel XFS code supports windows attributes. 

It will not require any dump/restore code or dump media format
changes, and with the existing SET policy if the destination kernel
and/or filesystem doesn't support those attributes then they will be
silently dropped on restore...

Seriously, I said no because I undestand how these interfaces have
been used for the past 20 years. If you want to change the
fundamental behavioural characteristics of the API, then you have to
make sure that it works with the way xfsdump/restore use the API
across the dump media format. i.e. the consumer of the GET
information can be a SET operation on a different kernel and
filesystem.

I've already said no to a new syscall because it's just a set
of feature bits that can be added to FS_XFLAGS. And the added
advantage of that is that any backup program that already supports
backing up the fsxattr information will also support it without API
or dump media format changes. i.e. we get widespread support for the
windows attributes pretty much for free.

Yet here we are, with people instead wanting to construct complex
new APIs which will require entirely new infrastructure across the
board to support.

Your call - windows attribute support via a small amount of work for
an existing API addition, or a huge amount of work across the entire
filesystem ecosystem for a whole new API. The end functionality will
be identical, but one path is a whole lot less work for everyone
than the other....

-Dave.
