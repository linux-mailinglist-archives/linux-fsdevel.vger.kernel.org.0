Which is just as awful. Just because it's done somewhere else
doesn't make it right.

Sure, but nobody is suggesting we support direct DMA buffer mapping
and reuse for network devices right now, whereas we have working
code for block devices in front of us.

What I want to see is broad-based generic block device based
filesysetm support, not niche functionality that can only work on a
single type of block device. Network filesystems and devices are a
*long* way from being able to do anything like this, so I don't see
a need to cater for them at this point in time.

When someone has a network device abstraction and network filesystem
that can do direct data placement based on that device abstraction,
then we can talk about the high level interface we should use to
drive it....

I cannot form a picture of what you are suggesting from such a brief
description. Care to explain in more detail?

Cheers,

Dave.
