Yes, indeed
The discard can help to free unusable spaces back to storage cluster.
But do discard after every commit can be disaster,
 - the jbd2 commit kthread can be blocked for long time sometimes, and
   then all of the metadata modify operations are blocked due to no log
   space
 - the flooding discard can saturate the storage backend and then the
   real write operations are blocked, especially the jbd2 log records

Even in the system with this patch, we can still observed the log write IO
can be blocked by the discard T_T...

Schedule a background trim task in kernel when the storage is not so busy 
and pick up a block group that that has bigger enough free blocks.
This sounds fair.
