I have tested the patch set and the changes work as expected.
Test steps - Had an instance with 64G memory and allocated 50G in 
hugepages of size 2M and 1G.

(Shamelessly copying the result format used by Chen Huang for easier 
co-relation :) )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
                       2M page                     |                       1G page                      |
-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
        enable          |        disable           |        enable Â          |          disable         |
-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
total  |  used  | free | total   |  used  | free  | total  |  used  | free  |  total  |  used  | free  |
64,312 | 51,576 |12,574| 63,514  | 51,368 | 11,956| 64,312 | 51,361 | 12,789| 63,514  | 51,362 | 11,962|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

One thing to be aware of, though, is that the gain in memory from 
freeing page struct after hugepage reservation shows up in 'used' memory 
after unreserving hugepages

As an example, with using 50G worth of hugepages of size 1G.
Before hugepage reservation

|-------------------------|
| total  |  used  |  free |
| 63,512 |  206   | 63,083|
|-------------------------|

After reserving 50 pages of 1G

|----------------------------|
| total  |  used    | free   |
| 64,312 |  51,361  | 12,789 |
|----------------------------|

After unreserving hugepages in previous step

|-------------------------|
| total  |  used  |  free |
| 64,312 |  966   | 63,184|
|-------------------------|

> Todo:
>    - Free all of the tail vmemmap pages
>      Now for the 2MB HugrTLB page, we only free 6 vmemmap pages. we really can
>      free 7 vmemmap pages. In this case, we can see 8 of the 512 struct page
>      structures has beed set PG_head flag. If we can adjust compound_head()
>      slightly and make compound_head() return the real head struct page when
>      the parameter is the tail struct page but with PG_head flag set.
>
>      In order to make the code evolution route clearer. This feature can can be
>      a separate patch after this patchset is solid.
>
>    - Support for other architectures (e.g. aarch64).
>    - Enable PMD/huge page mapping of vmemmap even if this feature was enabled.
