Maybe, but that philosophy (in a roundabout way) is what's resulted
in some of the problems we now have. Granted it's blind application
of that philosophy rather than the philosophy itself but that is
what happens.

I get that your comments are driven by the way that philosophy should
be applied which is more of a "if it works best doing it that way then
do it that way, and that's usually a file".

In this case there is a logical division of various types of file
system information and the underlying suggestion is maybe it's time
to move away from the "everything is a file" hard and fast rule,
and get rid of some of the problems that have resulted from it.

The notifications is an example, yes, the delivery mechanism is
a "file" but the design of the queueing mechanism makes a lot of
sense for the throughput that's going to be needed as time marches
on. Then there's different sub-systems each with unique information
that needs to be deliverable some other way because delivering "all"
the information via the notification would be just plain wrong so
a multi-faceted information delivery mechanism makes the most
sense to allow specific targeted retrieval of individual items of
information.

But that also supposes your at least open to the idea that "maybe
not everything should be a file".
