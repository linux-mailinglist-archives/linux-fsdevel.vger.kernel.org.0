Because otherwise you either need *all* paths leading to link_path_walk()
duplicate the logics (and get hurt whenever you miss one) or have "well,
in some cases link_path_walk() handles ERR_PTR() given to it, in some
cases its caller do" mess.

I'm referring to the fact that your diff is with an already modified path_lookupat()
_and_ those modifications have managed to introduce a bug your patch reverts.
No terminate_walk() paired with that path_init() failure, i.e. path_init() is
responsible for cleanups on its (many) failure exits...
