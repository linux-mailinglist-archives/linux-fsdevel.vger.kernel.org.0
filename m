Well ... moving forwards then.

I agree here ... but problem definition is supposed to be the job of
the submitter and fully laid out in the cover letter.

My answer to this would be the same list of people who'd be responsible
for ack'ing the patches.  However, we're always very reluctant to ack
designs in case people don't like the look of the code when it appears
and don't want to be bound by the ack on the design.  I think we can
get around this by making it clear that design acks are equivalent to
"This sounds OK but I won't know for definite until I see the code"

Actually, I don't see who should ack being an unknown.  The MAINTAINERS
file covers most of the kernel and a set of scripts will tell you based
on your code who the maintainers are ... that would seem to be the
definitive ack list.

I think the problem is the ack list for features covering large areas
is large and the problems come when the acker's don't agree ... some
like it, some don't.  The only deadlock breaking mechanism we have for
this is either Linus yelling at everyone or something happening to get
everyone into alignment (like an MM summit meeting).  Our current model
seems to be every acker has a foot on the brake, which means a single
nack can derail the process.  It gets even worse if you get a couple of
nacks each requesting mutually conflicting things.

We also have this other problem of subsystems not being entirely
collaborative.  If one subsystem really likes it and another doesn't,
there's a fear in the maintainers of simply being overridden by the
pull request going through the liking subsystem's tree.  This could be
seen as a deadlock breaking mechanism, but fear of this happening
drives overreactions.

We could definitely do a clear definition of who is allowed to nack and
when can that be overridden.

This is usual for all large patches, though, and the author gets to
design this.

In most large patches I've worked on, the maintainers raise worry about
various areas (usually performance) and the author gets to design tests
to validate or invalidate the concern ... which can become very open
ended if the concern is vague.

You mean like a cover letter?  Or do you mean a living document that
the acker's could comment on and amend?
