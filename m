I can't see writing byte-range code for a kernel that doesn't support
that yet.  How would I test it?

I was hoping they'd be in the same space, with the old interface just
defined to deal in locks with range [0,âˆž).

I'm just worried about getting the interface wrong if it's specified
without being implemented.  Maybe this is straightforward enough that
there's not a risk, I don't know.
