I'm looking at the liburing interface for it and I'm only seeing
io_uring_unregister_buffers() / IORING_UNREGISTER_BUFFERS which works
on the entire table, so I'm wondering how that interface would work if
pinning/unpinning was at the entry level?

For fuse, it holds the reference to the buffer for the lifetime of the
connection, which could be a very long time. I'm not seeing how we
could let userspace succeed in unregistering with fuse continuing to
hold that reference, since as I understand it conceptually,
unregistering the buffer should give ownership of the buffer
completely back to userspace.

Yep you have that right, the buffer node in question is the one at
FUSE_URING_FIXED_HEADERS_INDEX which is where all the headers for
requests are placed.

I don't think pinning the buffer table has a similar issue because we
disallow unregistration if it's pinned.

> pin if it wants to modify the buffer registrations? I would imagine

For the fuse use case, the server never really modifies its buffer
registrations as it sets up everything before initiating the
connection. But if it wanted to in the future, the server could send a
fuse notification to the kernel to unpin the buf table.

Fuse has something similar where the server can abort the connection,
and that will release the pin / other io uring resources.
