All right, I thought a bit more about that and returned to your
original BPF idea you mentioned on 2020-08-28:

Instead of changing fanotify's filesystem notification functionality,
I suggest to rather **add a tracing mode (fantrace)**.

The synchronous handling of syscalls via ptrace is of course required
for debugging purposes, however that introduces a major slowdown (even
with seccomp-bpf filters). There are a number of cases, including
[1-3], where async processing of file events of specific tasks would be
fine but is not readily available in Linux. Fanotify already ships
important infrastructure in this regard: it provides very fast
event-buffering and, by using file descriptors instead of resolved
paths, a clean and race-free API to process the events later. However,
as already stated, fanotify does not provide a clean way, to monitor
only a subset of tasks. Therefore please consider the following
proposed architecture of fantrace:

Each taks gets its own struct fsnotify_group. Within
fsnotify.c:fsnotify() it is checked if the given task has a
fsnotify_group attached where events of interest are buffered as usual.
Note that this is an additional hook - sysadmins being subscribed to
filesystem events rather than task-filesystem-events are notified as
usual - in that case two hooks possibly run. The fsnotify_group is
extended by a field optionally pointing to a BPF program which allows
for custom filters to be run.

Some implementation details:
- To let the tracee return quickly, run BPF filter program within tracer
   context during read(fan_fd) but before events are copied to userspace
- only one fantracer per task, which overrides existing ones if any
- task->fsnotify_group refcount increment on fork, decrement on exit (run
   after exit_files(tsk) to not miss final close events). When last task
   exited, send EOF to listener.
- on exec of seuid-programs the fsnotify_group is cleared (like in ptrace)
- lazy check when event occurs, if listener is still alive (refcount > 1)
- for the beginning, to keep things simple and to "solve" the cleanup of
   filesystem marks, I suggest to disable i_fsnotify_marks for fantrace
   (only allow FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM), as that functionality can be
   implemented within the user-provided BPF-program.

A working implementation of this concept, which effectively does the
same using hardcoded filter rules can be found in my kernel module
shournalk [4]. For instance In kernel/event_handler.c:event_handler_fput()
it is checked, if the task is observed using a hashtable, and if so,
the event is stored to a buffer corresponding to that process tree.

Thanks
Tycho
