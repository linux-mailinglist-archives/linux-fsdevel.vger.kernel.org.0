Thanks for the testing! What settings did you use? I think Chrome OS was
effectively doing this?

PROC_MEM_RESTRICT_OPEN_READ_OFF=y
CONFIG_PROC_MEM_RESTRICT_OPEN_WRITE_ALL=y
CONFIG_PROC_MEM_RESTRICT_WRITE_ALL=y
CONFIG_PROC_MEM_RESTRICT_FOLL_FORCE_ALL=y

Though I don't see the FOLL_FORCE changes in the linked Chrome OS patch,
but I suspect it's unreachable with
CONFIG_PROC_MEM_RESTRICT_OPEN_WRITE_ALL=y.
