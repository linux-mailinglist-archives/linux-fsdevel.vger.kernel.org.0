One thing to keep in mind is that a generic VFS level comparing function
will only catch the obvious case where you have dup() equivalency as
outlined above by Linus. That's what most people are interested in and
that could easily replace most kcmp() use-cases for comparing fds.

But, of course there's the case where you have two file descriptors
referring to two different files that reference the same underlying
object (usually stashed in file->private_data).

For most cases that problem can ofc be solved by comparing the
underlying inode. But that doesn't work for drivers using the generic
anonymous inode infrastructure because it uses the same inode for
everything or for cases where the same underlying object can even be
represented by different inodes.

So for such cases a driver specific ioctl() to compare two fds will
be needed in addition to the generic helper.
