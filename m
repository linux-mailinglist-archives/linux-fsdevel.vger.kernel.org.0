I was just looking over this code and made the same kmap -> kmap_local
change, but you've done a more complete version - nice.

For context, I was the one who added the kmap() call, because
copy_to_user() can sleep - anything else at the time would've been more
awkward, and highmem machines were already on the way out. But
kmap_local is perfect here :)
