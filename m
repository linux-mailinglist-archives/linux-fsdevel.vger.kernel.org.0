Yeah, right. But for both OFD and flock they shouldn't hit this issue, 
because it when removing all the locks having the same owner, which is 
the 'file', passed by filp_close(filp), the 'file' reference counter 
must be larger than 0. Because the filp_close() is still using it.

This is why using the thread id as the owner is a special case for 
Posix-style lock.

Yeah, I also think this approach is ugly :-)

Okay, this sounds good.

Let me try this tomorrow.

I will send a V2 later.

Thanks Jeff!
