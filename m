A bio_vec is also used for networking; it's in disguise as an skb_frag,
but it's there.

I don't even know if what you're proposing is possible.  Consider a
network filesystem which might transparently be moved from one network
interface to another.  I don't even know if the filesystem would know
which network device is going to be used for the IO at the time of
IO submission.

I think a totally different model is needed where we can find out if
the bvec contains pages which are already mapped to the device, and map
them if they aren't.  That also handles a DM case where extra devices
are hot-added to a RAID, for example.
