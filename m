I didn't mean to make it sound like you did anything wrong or I was
blaming you. I was literally just trying to say we had weird behavior in
this area for legitimate reasons. Posix states this:

    If posix_getdents() is called concurrently with an operation that
    adds, deletes, or modifies a directory entry, the results from
    posix_getdents() shall reflect either all of the effects of the
    concurrent operation or none of them. If a sequence of calls to
    posix_getdents() is made that reads from offset zero to end-of-file
    and a file is removed from or added to the directory between the
    first and last of those calls, whether the sequence of calls returns
    an entry for that file is unspecified.

Which to me all reads like we're pretty much free in what to do as long
as we clearly document it.

No horry.
