Mark preceded me with his reply, which is perfectly summarising
the whole point of this series. â€“ Thank you Mark!

As for FD_SETFD, yes it's not necessary. The only reason I
changed the variable was to denote the argument as being
classified as an `int` as per the man page. If I were not to
change it, it would have been the only command with an `int`
argument not to use `argi`. Therefore it's also for
consistency's sake.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Luca
