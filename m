Adding fsdevel so we're aware of this quirk.

So I'm not sure whether this was ever discussed on fsdevel when you took
the decision to treat fd 0 as AT_FDCWD or in general treat fd 0 as an
invalid value.

If it was discussed then great but if not then I would like to make it
very clear that if in the future you decide to introduce custom
semantics for vfs provided infrastructure - especially when exposed to
userspace - that you please Cc us.

You often make it very clear on the list that you don't like it when
anything that touches bpf code doesn't end up getting sent to the bpf
mailing list. It is exactly the same for us.

This is not a rant I'm really just trying to make sure that we agree on
common ground when it comes to touching each others code or semantic
assumptions.

I personally find this extremely weird to treat fd 0 as anything other
than a random fd number as it goes against any userspace assumptions and
drastically deviates from basically every file descriptor interface we
have. I mean, you're not just saying fd 0 is invalid you're even saying
it means AT_FDCWD.

For every other interface, including those that pass fds in structs
whose extensibility is premised on unknown fields being set to zero,
have ways to make fd 0 work just fine. You could've done that to without
inventing custom fd semantics.
