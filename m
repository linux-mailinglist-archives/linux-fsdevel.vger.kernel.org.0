I'd rather agree that it's my cycle-picking. The case I care about
is CONFIG_AUDIT=y (because everybody enable it), and io_uring
tracing _not_ enabled at runtime. If enabled let them suffer
the overhead, it will probably dip down the performance

So, for the case I care about it's two of

if (unlikely(audit_enabled && current->audit_context))

in the hot path. load-test-jump + current, so it will
be around 7x2 instructions. We can throw away audit_enabled
as you say systemd already enables it, that will give
4x2 instructions including 2 conditional jumps.

That's not great at all. And that's why I brought up
the question about need of pre and post hooks and whether
can be combined. Would be just 4 instructions and that is
ok (ish).

I'm curious, why it's enabled by many distros by default? Are there
use cases they use? Tempting to add AUDIT_IOURING=default N, but
won't work I guess
