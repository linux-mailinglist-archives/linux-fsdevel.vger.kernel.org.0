Except it doesn't, I'm not interested in adding per-request type fields
to the generic part of it. Before we know it, we'll blow past the next
cacheline.

If we can find space in the kiocb, that'd be much better. Note that once
the async buffered bits go in for 5.9, then there's no longer a 4-byte
hole in struct kiocb.

Really don't think that matters at all.
