I should note that the reason I'm saying it makes reasoning about
permissions easier is that this here guarantees that:

file->f_cred->user_ns == file->f_path.dentry->d_sb->s_user_ns

So cases where you would need to check that you have permissions in the
openers userns are equivalent to checking permissions in the token's and
therefore bpffs' userns.

I'll take a look.
