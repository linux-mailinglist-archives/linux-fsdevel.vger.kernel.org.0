+======================
+XFS Online Fsck Design
+======================
+
+This document captures the design of the online filesystem check feature for
+XFS.
+The purpose of this document is threefold:
+
+- To help kernel distributors understand exactly what the XFS online fsck
+  feature is, and issues about which they should be aware.
+
+- To help people reading the code to familiarize themselves with the relevant
+  concepts and design points before they start digging into the code.
+
+- To help developers maintaining the system by capturing the reasons
+  supporting higher level decisionmaking.
+
+As the online fsck code is merged, the links in this document to topic branches
+will be replaced with links to code.
+
+This document is licensed under the terms of the GNU Public License, v2.
+The primary author is Darrick J. Wong.
+
+This design document is split into seven parts.
+Part 1 defines what fsck tools are and the motivations for writing a new one.
+Parts 2 and 3 present a high level overview of how online fsck process works
+and how it is tested to ensure correct functionality.
+Part 4 discusses the user interface and the intended usage modes of the new
+program.
+Parts 5 and 6 show off the high level components and how they fit together, and
+then present case studies of how each repair function actually works.
+Part 7 sums up what has been discussed so far and speculates about what else
+might be built atop online fsck.

+
+1. What is a Filesystem Check?
+==============================
+
+A Unix filesystem has three main jobs: to provide a hierarchy of names through
+which application programs can associate arbitrary blobs of data for any
+length of time, to virtualize physical storage media across those names, and
+to retrieve the named data blobs at any time.
+The filesystem check (fsck) tool examines all the metadata in a filesystem
+to look for errors.
+Simple tools only check for obvious corruptions, but the more sophisticated
+ones cross-reference metadata records to look for inconsistencies.
+People do not like losing data, so most fsck tools also contains some ability
+to deal with any problems found.
+As a word of caution -- the primary goal of most Linux fsck tools is to restore
+the filesystem metadata to a consistent state, not to maximize the data
+recovered.
+That precedent will not be challenged here.
+
+Filesystems of the 20th century generally lacked any redundancy in the ondisk
+format, which means that fsck can only respond to errors by erasing files until
+errors are no longer detected.
+System administrators avoid data loss by increasing the number of separate
+storage systems through the creation of backups; and they avoid downtime by
+increasing the redundancy of each storage system through the creation of RAID.
+More recent filesystem designs contain enough redundancy in their metadata that
+it is now possible to regenerate data structures when non-catastrophic errors
+occur; this capability aids both strategies.
+Over the past few years, XFS has added a storage space reverse mapping index to
+make it easy to find which files or metadata objects think they own a
+particular range of storage.
+Efforts are under way to develop a similar reverse mapping index for the naming
+hierarchy, which will involve storing directory parent pointers in each file.
+With these two pieces in place, XFS uses secondary information to perform more
+sophisticated repairs.
+
+TLDR; Show Me the Code!
+-----------------------
+
+Code is posted to the kernel.org git trees as follows:
+`kernel changes <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfs-linux.git/log/?h=repair-symlink>`_,
+`userspace changes <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfsprogs-dev.git/log/?h=scrub-media-scan-service>`_, and
+`QA test changes <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfstests-dev.git/log/?h=repair-dirs>`_.
+Each kernel patchset adding an online repair function will use the same branch
+name across the kernel, xfsprogs, and fstests git repos.
+
+Existing Tools
+--------------
+
+The online fsck tool described here will be the third tool in the history of
+XFS (on Linux) to check and repair filesystems.
+Two programs precede it:
+
+The first program, ``xfs_check``, was created as part of the XFS debugger
+(``xfs_db``) and can only be used with unmounted filesystems.
+It walks all metadata in the filesystem looking for inconsistencies in the
+metadata, though it lacks any ability to repair what it finds.
+Due to its high memory requirements and inability to repair things, this
+program is now deprecated and will not be discussed further.
+
+The second program, ``xfs_repair``, was created to be faster and more robust
+than the first program.
+Like its predecessor, it can only be used with unmounted filesystems.
+It uses extent-based in-memory data structures to reduce memory consumption,
+and tries to schedule readahead IO appropriately to reduce I/O waiting time
+while it scans the metadata of the entire filesystem.
+The most important feature of this tool is its ability to respond to
+inconsistencies in file metadata and directory tree by erasing things as needed
+to eliminate problems.
+Space usage metadata are rebuilt from the observed file metadata.
+
+Problem Statement
+-----------------
+
+The current XFS tools leave several problems unsolved:
+
+1. **User programs** suddenly **lose access** to information in the computer
+   when unexpected shutdowns occur as a result of silent corruptions in the
+   filesystem metadata.
+   These occur **unpredictably** and often without warning.
+
+2. **Users** experience a **total loss of service** during the recovery period
+   after an **unexpected shutdown** occurs.
+
+3. **Users** experience a **total loss of service** if the filesystem is taken
+   offline to **look for problems** proactively.
+
+4. **Data owners** cannot **check the integrity** of their stored data without
+   reading all of it.
+   This may expose them to substantial billing costs when a linear media scan
+   might suffice.
+
+5. **System administrators** cannot **schedule** a maintenance window to deal
+   with corruptions if they **lack the means** to assess filesystem health
+   while the filesystem is online.
+
+6. **Fleet monitoring tools** cannot **automate periodic checks** of filesystem
+   health when doing so requires **manual intervention** and downtime.
+
+7. **Users** can be tricked into **doing things they do not desire** when
+   malicious actors **exploit quirks of Unicode** to place misleading names
+   in directories.
+
+Given this definition of the problems to be solved and the actors who would
+benefit, the proposed solution is a third fsck tool that acts on a running
+filesystem.
+
+This new third program has three components: an in-kernel facility to check
+metadata, an in-kernel facility to repair metadata, and a userspace driver
+program to drive fsck activity on a live filesystem.
+``xfs_scrub`` is the name of the driver program.
+The rest of this document presents the goals and use cases of the new fsck
+tool, describes its major design points in connection to those goals, and
+discusses the similarities and differences with existing tools.
+

+| Throughout this document, the existing offline fsck tool can also be     |
+| referred to by its current name "``xfs_repair``".                        |
+| The userspace driver program for the new online fsck tool can be         |
+| referred to as "``xfs_scrub``".                                          |
+| The kernel portion of online fsck that validates metadata is called      |
+| "online scrub", and portion of the kernel that fixes metadata is called  |
+| "online repair".                                                         |
++--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
+
+Secondary metadata indices enable the reconstruction of parts of a damaged
+primary metadata object from secondary information.
+XFS filesystems shard themselves into multiple primary objects to enable better
+performance on highly threaded systems and to contain the blast radius when
+problems happen.
+The naming hierarchy is broken up into objects known as directories and files;
+and the physical space is split into pieces known as allocation groups.
+The division of the filesystem into principal objects (allocation groups and
+inodes) means that there are ample opportunities to perform targeted checks and
+repairs on a subset of the filesystem.
+While this is going on, other parts continue processing IO requests.
+Even if a piece of filesystem metadata can only be regenerated by scanning the
+entire system, the scan can still be done in the background while other file
+operations continue.
+
+In summary, online fsck takes advantage of resource sharding and redundant
+metadata to enable targeted checking and repair operations while the system
+is running.
+This capability will be coupled to automatic system management so that
+autonomous self-healing of XFS maximizes service availability.
