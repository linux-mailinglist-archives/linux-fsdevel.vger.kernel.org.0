Hmm...  Sure, you'll be pushing it to the same io_wqe it went through originally,
but you are still in context of io_uring_release() caller, aren't you?

So you call io_wqe_wake_worker(), and it decides that all threads are busy,
but ->nr_workers is still below ->max_workers.  And proceeds to
	create_io_worker(wqe->wq, wqe, acct->index);
which will create a new io-worker thread, but do that in the thread group of
current, i.e. the caller of io_uring_release().  Looks like we'd get
an io-worker thread with the wrong parent...

What am I missing here?
