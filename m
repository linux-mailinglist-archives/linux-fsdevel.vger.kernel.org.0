Yes, that's correct.

I like the idea of factoring out a function out balance_dirty_pages(), however

I see two challenges:
- the write operation has already completed at this point,
- so we can't really sleep on its completion in the io-worker in io-uring
- we don't know how long to sleep in io-uring

Currently balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited() is called at the end of the function
iomap_write_iter(). If the function balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited() would instead
be called at the beginning of the function iomap_write_iter() we could return -EAGAIN
and then complete it in the io-worker.

I'm not sure what the implications are of moving the function call to the beginning of
the function iomap_write_iter().
