Since when did Linux kernel submissions become "show me a better patch"
to reject something obviously bad?

As I said the right approach is to probably (pending comments from the
actual fat maintainer) to merge exfat support into the existing fs/fat/
codebase.  You obviously seem to disagree (and at the same time not).

But using this as a pre-text of adding a non-disabled second fat16/32
implementation and actually allowing that to build with no reason is
just not how it works.

In other words you have no actual plan and no idea what to do and want to
rely on "others" to do anything, but at the same time reject the
comments from others how to do things right?

And all of that you can easily do by just sending out a patch series.
And maybe actually listening to comments.

You generally get a lot of review and comments by posting to the mailing
list.  But what really helps is to just do the very basic homework
beforehand.  And it also really helps to have a plan what you want to
do with a codebase you just copy and pasted from somewhere.
