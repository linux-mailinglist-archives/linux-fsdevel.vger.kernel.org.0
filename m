FWIW, we can remove bpf_cpumask_full() and any other affected
bpf_cpumask kfuncs if we need to. kfuncs have no strict stability
guarantees (they're kernel symbols meant for use by kernel programs, see
[0]), so we can remove them without worrying about user space breakages
or stability issues. They were also added relatively recently, and as
far as I know, Tejun and I are thus far the only people using them.

[0]: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/tree/Documentation/bpf/kfuncs.rst#n350

Of course, I'd prefer that we didn't remove any of them, but if we have
to then BPF won't get in the way. As you pointed out below, there are
scenarios beyond cpumask_full() where (many) non-BPF callers could trip
on this as well, so IMO what we have today makes sense (assuming there's
not some other clever way to correctly optimize for NR_CPUS without the
extra config option, as you also said below).

Thanks,
David
