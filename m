Ah, of course. Sorry for the confusion, I was kinda using
dm-snapshot as shorthand for "dm-thinp + snapshots".

Why?  How is the guarantee the block device has to provide to
provisioned areas different for user vs filesystem internal
provisioned space?

Snapshotting is a clone operation, not a dedupe operation.

Yes, the end result of both is that you have a block shared between
multiple indexes that needs COW on the next overwrite, but the two
operations that get to that point are very different...

Let's not try to add everyone's favourite pony to this interface
before we've even got it off the ground.

It's the simple precision of the API, the lack of cross-layer
communication requirements and the ability to implement and optimise
the independent layers independently that makes this a very
appealing solution.

We need to start with getting the simple stuff working and prove the
concept. Then once we can observe the behaviour of a working system
we can start working on optimising individual layers for efficiency
and performance....

Cheers,

Dave.
