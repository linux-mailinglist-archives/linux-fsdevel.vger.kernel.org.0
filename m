For me, the primary motivation of posting this patch is to have a way to
make the number of active objects reported in /proc/slabinfo more
accurately reflect the number of objects that are actually being used by
the kernel. When measuring changes in slab objects consumption between
successive run of a certain workload, I can more easily see the amount
of increase. Without that, the data will have much more noise and it
will be harder to see a pattern.
