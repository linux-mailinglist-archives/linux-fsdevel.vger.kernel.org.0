Yes.  FUA is an used an an optimization so that we can avid the
generic_write_sync or similar call if a O_DSYNC write doesn't need
any metadata update.  If the caller already does the generic_write_sync
equivalent we don't also need FUA.  It is not actually harmful in that
it gives worse results, but it will kill performance.
