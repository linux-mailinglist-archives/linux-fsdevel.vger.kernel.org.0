Per-task direct pipe can transfer page between two files or one
file and other kernel components, especially by splice_direct_to_actor
and __splice_from_pipe().

This way is helpful for fuse/ublk to implement zero copy by transferring
pages from device to file or socket. However, when device's ->splice_read()
produces pages, the kernel consumer may read from or write to these pages,
and from device viewpoint, there could be unexpected read or write on
pages.

Enhance the limit by the following approach:

1) add kernel splice flags of SPLICE_F_KERN_FOR_[READ|WRITE] which is
   passed to device's ->read_splice(), then device can check if this
   READ or WRITE is expected on pages filled to pipe together with
   information from ppos & len

2) add kernel splice flag of SPLICE_F_KERN_NEED_CONFIRM which is passed
   to device's ->read_splice() for asking device to confirm if it
   really supports this kind of usage of feeding pages by ->read_splice().
   If device does support, pipe->ack_page_consuming is set. This way
   can avoid misuse.
