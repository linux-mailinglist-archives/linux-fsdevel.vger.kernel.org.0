That's a pretty blanket statement. If the list is heavily shared, and
hence contended, yes that's generally true. But it isn't.

I actually went and checked instead of guessing, and find isn't doing a
stat by default on the files.

For sure, you can't directly compare the sys times. But the actual
runtime is of course directly comparable. The actual example is btrfs,
which heavily offloads to threads as well. So the find case doesn't show
you the full picture either. Note that once the reworked worker scheme
is adopted, sys time will be directly attributed to the original task
and it will be included (for io_uring, not talking about btrfs).

I'm going to ignore the rest of this email as it isn't productive going
down that path. Suffice it to say that ideally _no_ operations will be
using the async offload, that's really only for regular file IO where
you cannot poll for readiness. And even those cases are gradually being
improved to not rely on it, like for async buffered reads. We still
need to handle writes better, and ideally things like this as well. But
that's a bit further out.
