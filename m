At that time you was OK with CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS, only suggested to
hide it behind CONFIG_EXPERT:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/Yzx4fSmmr8bh6gdl@yury-laptop/T/#m92d405527636154c3b2000e0105379170d988315

This all was just broken. For example, as I mentioned in commit message,
cpumask_full() was broken. I know because I wrote a test. There were no
a single user for the function, and nobody complained. Now we have one
in BPF code. So if we simply revert the aa47a7c215e, it will hurt real
users.

The pre-CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS cpumask machinery would work only if you
set NR_CPUS to the number that matches to the actual number of CPUs as
detected at boot time.

In your example, if you have NR_CPUS == 64, and for some reason disable
hyper threading, nr_cpumask_bits will be set to 64 at compile time, but
nr_cpu_ids will be set to 32 at boot time, assuming
CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is disabled.

And the following code will be broken:

cpumask_t m1, m2;

cpumask_setall(m1); // m1 is ffff ffff ffff ffff because it uses
                    // compile-time optimized nr_cpumask_bits

for_each_cpu(cpu, m1) // 32 iterations because it relied on nr_cpu_ids
        cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, m2); // m2 is ffff ffff XXXX XXXX

BUG_ON(!cpumask_equal(m1, m2)); // Bug because it will test all 64 bits

Today with CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS disabled, kernel consistently relies
on boot-time defined nr_cpu_ids in functions like cpumask_equal()
with the cost of disabled runtime optimizations.

If CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS is enabled, it wires nr_cpu_ids to NR_CPUS
at compile time, which allows compile-time optimization.

If CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS is enabled, but actual number of CPUs doesn't
match to NR_CPUS, the kernel throws a warning at boot time - better
than nothing.

I'm not happy bothering people with a new config parameter in such a
simple case. I just don't know how to fix it better. Is there a safe
way to teach compiler to optimize against NR_CPUS other than telling
it explicitly?

From distro people's perspective, 'one size fits all' is the best
approach. It's hard to blame them.

Thanks,
