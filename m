mnt_add_count() on _what_?  Failure in legitimize_links() ends up with
nd->path.mnt zeroed, in both callers.  So which vfsmount would be
affected?

Rules:
	in RCU mode: no mounts pinned
	out of RCU mode: nd->path.mnt and all nd->stack[i].link.mnt for
			i below nd->depth are either NULL or pinned

Transition from RCU to non-RCU mode happens in try_to_unlazy() and
try_to_unlazy_next().

References (if any) are dropped by eventual terminate_walk() (after
that the contents of nameidata is junk).

__legitimize_mnt() is the primitive for pinning.  Return values:
	0 -- successfully pinned (or given NULL as an argument)
	1 -- failed, refcount not affected
	-1 -- failed, refcount bumped.
It stays in RCU mode in all cases.

One user is __legitimize_path(); it also stays in RCU mode.  If it
fails to legitimize path->mnt, it will zero it *IF* __legitimize_mnt()
reports that refcount hadn't been taken.  In all other cases,
path->mnt is pinned.  IOW, the caller is responsible for path_put()
regardless of the outcome.

Another user is legitimize_mnt().  _That_ will make sure that
refcount is unaffected in case of failure (IOW, if __legitimize_mnt()
reports failure with refcount bumped, we drop out of RCU mode,
do mntput() and go back).

On failure in legitimize_links() we either leave nd->depth equal to zero
(in which case all nd->stack[...].link.mnt are to be ignored) or
we set it one higher than the last attempted legitimize_path() in there.
In the latter case, all entries in nd->stack below the value we put into
nd->depth had legitimize_path() called (and thus have ->mnt either NULL
or pinned) and everything starting from nd->depth is to be ignored.

nd->path handling:
1) Callers of legitimize_links() are responsible for zeroing nd->path.mnt
on legitimize_links() failure.  Both do that, AFAICS.
2) in try_to_unlazy() we proceed to call legitimize_path() on nd->path.
Once that call is done, we have nd->path.mnt pinned or NULL, so nothing
further is needed with it.
3) in try_to_unlazy_next() we use legitimize_mnt() instead.  Failure
of that is handled by zeroing nd->path.mnt; success means that nd->path.mnt
is pinned and should be left alone.

We could use __legitimize_mnt() in try_to_unlazy_next() (basically,
substitute the body of legitimize_mnt() there and massage it a bit),
but that ends up being harder to follow:
	res = __legitimize_mnt(nd->path.mnt, nd->m_seq);
	if (unlikely(res)) {
		if (res < 0)	// pinned, leave it there
			goto out1;
		else		// not pinned, zero it
			goto out2;
	}
instead of
        if (unlikely(!legitimize_mnt(nd->path.mnt, nd->m_seq)))
		goto out2;
we have now.
