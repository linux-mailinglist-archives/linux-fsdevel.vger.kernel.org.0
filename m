But I mean then wouldn't this already be a problem today?
kiocb_modified() can error out with EAGAIN today:

          ret = inode_needs_update_time(inode, &now);
          if (ret <= 0)
                  return ret;
          if (flags & IOCB_NOWAIT)
                  return -EAGAIN;

          return __file_update_time(file, &now, ret);

the thing is that it doesn't matter for ->write_iter() - for xfs at
least - because xfs does it as part of preparatory checks before
actually doing any real work. The problem happens when you do actual
work and afterwards call kiocb_modified(). That's why I think (2) is
preferable.

Yes, that's what I'm talking about. I'm asking whether that's ok for xfs
maintainers basically. i_op->write_iter() already works like that since
the dawn of time but i_op->read_iter doesn't and I'm proposing to make
it work like that and wondering if there's any issues I'm unaware of.

I think that would be the wrong approach and is definitely not what I
meant.
