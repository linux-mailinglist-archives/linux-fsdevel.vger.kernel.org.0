The cgroup design is to do what we do usually, but within settable hard
and soft limits.  So if the kernel could make GFP_KERNEL wait without
failing, the cgroup would mirror that.

Warn on allocation above a certain size without MAY_FAIL would seem to
cover all those cases.  If there is a case for requiring instant
allocation, you always have GFP_ATOMIC, and, I suppose, we could even
do a bounded reclaim allocation where it tries for a certain time then
fails.

OOM Killer is the most extreme outcome.  Usually reclaim (hugely
simplified) dumps clean cache first and tries the shrinkers then tries
to write out dirty cache.  Only after that hasn't found anything after
a few iterations will the oom killer get activated.

That might be true for your use case, but it certainly isn't true for a
cheap hosting cloud using containers: overcommit is where you make your
money, so it's absolutely standard operating procedure.  I wouldn't
call cheap hosting a "highly controlled environment" they're just
making a bet they won't get caught out too often.

OK, this seems to be specific to your use case again, because if you
look at what the major user space processes like web browsers do, they
allocate way over the physical memory available to them for cache and
assume the kernel will take care of it.  Making failure a signal for
being over the working set would cause all these applications to
segfault almost immediately.

I think what you're asking for is an API to try to calculate what the
current available headroom in the working set would be?  That's highly
heuristic, but the mm people might have an idea how to do it.

Error legs are the least exercised and most bug, and therefore exploit,
prone pieces of code in C.  If we can get rid of them, we should.
