So I'm convinced the difference will be pretty much in the noise because of
how many dirty pages there have to be to even start throttling processes
but some more arguments are:

* we ratelimit calls to balance_dirty_pages() based on number of pages
  dirtied by the current process in balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited()

* balance_dirty_pages() uses number of pages dirtied by the current process
  to decide about the delay.

So the only situation where I could see this making a difference would be
if dirty limit is a handful of pages and even there I have hard time to see
how exactly. So I'm ok with the change and in the case we see it causes
problems somewhere, we'll think how to fix it based on the exact scenario.

I guess the above two points are the reason why Stefan writes about throttling
one page later because we count only number of pages dirtied until this
moment so the page dirtied by this iteration of loop in iomap_write_iter()
will get reflected only by the call to balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited() in
the next iteration (or the next call to iomap_write_iter()).
