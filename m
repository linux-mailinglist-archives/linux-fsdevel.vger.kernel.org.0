Moving from synchronize_rcu() to synchronize_rcu_expedited() does buy
you at least an order of magnitude.  But yes, it should be possible to
get rid of all but one call per batch, which would be better.  Maybe
a bit more complicated, but probably not that much.

Let me see what I can come up with.

If this is an emergency, I still suggest trying the patch as a short-term
workaround.

							Thanx, Paul
