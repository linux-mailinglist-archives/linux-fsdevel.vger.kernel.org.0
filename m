Well we could modify the IOMAP_INLINE code to handle iomap::offset > 0
so you could keep feeding the pagecache inline mappings as packets of
data become available.  But that statement is missing the point, since I
think you already /have/ the folios populated and stuffed in i_mapping;
you just need iomap for the sub-folio state tracking when things get
dirty.

I think we already did something like that for fsdax.

Yeah -- the sole user (gfs2) stores the inline data near the inode, so
->iomap_begin initiates a transaction and locks the inode and returns.
iomap copies data between the pagecache and iomap::addr, and calls
->iomap_end, which commits the transaction, unlocks the inode, and
cleans the page.  That's why writeback doesn't support IOMAP_INLINE;
there's no users for it.

If ext4 ever gets to handling inline data via iomap, I think they'd do a
similar dance.
