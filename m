Well, let me be more specific. If you have a simple hierarchical numeric
enforcement (assume higher priority more likely to be chosen and the
effective priority to be max(self, max(parents)) then the semantic
itslef is straightforward.

I am not really sure about the practical manageability though. I have
hard time to imagine priority assignment on something like a shared
workload with a more complex hierarchy. For example:
	    root
	/    |    \
cont_A    cont_B  cont_C

each container running its workload with own hierarchy structures that
might be rather dynamic during the lifetime. In order to have a
predictable OOM behavior you need to watch and reassign priorities all
the time, no?

This approach has a strong requirement on the memcg hierarchy
organization. Siblings have to be directly comparable because you cut
off many potential sub-trees this way (e.g. is it easy to tell
whether you want to rule out all system or user slices?).

I can imagine usecases where this could work reasonably well e.g. a set
of workers of a different priority all of them running under a shared
memcg parent. But more more involved hierarchies seem more complex
because you always keep in mind how the hierarchy is organize to get to
your desired victim.
