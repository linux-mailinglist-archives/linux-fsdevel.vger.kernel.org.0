Sorry, forgot that the term Advanced Format introduces ambiguity.
As far as the OSes are concerned the drive is 4Kn.

A very quick smoke test of a 16-ish TiB 4Kn partition seemed OK.

It cannot:

   $ ./udfinfo /dev/sdb1
   udfinfo: Error: UDF Volume Recognition Sequence found but not Anchor Volume Descriptor Pointer, maybe wrong --blocksize?
   udfinfo: Error: Cannot process device '/dev/sdb1' as UDF disk

   $ ./udfinfo --blocksize=4096 /dev/sdb1
   udfinfo: Error: UDF Volume Recognition Sequence not found
   udfinfo: Error: Cannot process device '/dev/sdb1' as UDF disk

   $ ./udfinfo
   udfinfo from udftools 2.1

Seemingly:

   $ blkid --info /dev/sdb1
   /dev/sdb1: MINIMUM_IO_SIZE="4096"
              PHYSICAL_SECTOR_SIZE="4096"
              LOGICAL_SECTOR_SIZE="4096"

   $ blkid --probe /dev/sdb1
   /dev/sdb1: VOLUME_ID="UDF Volume"
              UUID="0e131b3b20554446"
              VOLUME_SET_ID="0E131B3B UDF Volume Set"
              LABEL="WIN10_FORMATTED"
              LOGICAL_VOLUME_ID="WIN10_FORMATTED"
              VERSION="2.01"
              TYPE="udf"
              USAGE="filesystem"

   $ blkid --version
   blkid from util-linux 2.31.1  (libblkid 2.31.1, 19-Dec-2017)

> Can grub2 recognize such disks?

I'm not sure what you're asking here. The physical interface to this drive is USB,
and it's not designed for general-purpose storage (or booting). That said, if you
have some grub2 commands you want me to run against this drive/partition let me know.

Build failed:
   In file included from pt-tools.c:114:0:
   pt-tools.c: In function 'pt_limit_lookup':
   pt-limit.gperf:78:1: error: function might be candidate for attribute 'pure' [-Werror=suggest-attribute=pure]

If you send me some other SHA to try I can attempt a rebuild.

Fair enough, but it's also reasonable to assume the bugginess is
limited to the VRS corner case. AFAIK that's the only place in ECMA-167
where there is a difference in layout specific to 4K sectors.
With the BOOT2 band-aid chkdsk is able to analyze filesystems on 4Kn media.

I use chkdsk frequently to double-check UDF generation firmware
I am writing, and also udffsck work-in-progress.
