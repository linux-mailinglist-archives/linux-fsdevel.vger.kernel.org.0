I understand what is the point and I'm not against discussion how to fix
it. But it should be implemented for all filesystems with UNICODE
semantic, so behavior would be same.

For user application point of view, behavior of vfat, ntfs, udf and ext4
(with UNICODE support; see below) in handling file names should be very
similar (or exactly same if fs tech details allows it).

When using ext4 in default mode then it really does not apply here. But
I wrote that it applies for ext4 with UNICODE support. This mode needs
to be first enabled for directory, it is relatively new feature and I do
not know if there are users of it and how many people tried different
crazy test scenarios with normalization, etc...

OK!
