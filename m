The two are not related, blk-mq tag number means nothing wrt. io
handling order:

- tag is allocated via sbitmap, which may return tag number in any
  order, you may think the returned number is just random
- blk-mq may re-order requests and dispatch them with any order
- once requests are issued to io_uring, userspace may handles these IOs
  with any order
- after backend io is queued via io_uring or libaio or whatever to kernel, it
could be completed at any order

For ublk, the queue has fixed depth, so the pre-allocated io_uring size is
enough, and blk-mq can throttle IOs from the beginning if the max queue depth is
reached, so ublk needn't to worry about io_uring size/depth.

But fuse may have to consider request throttle.
