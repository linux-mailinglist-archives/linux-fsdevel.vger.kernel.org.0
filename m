Ok so this part can work out as you said, I hadn't understood what you
meant by "punt to the work queue" but that should work from my new
understanding of the ring; we can just return EAGAIN if the non-blocking
variant doesn't have immediate results and call the blocking variant
when we're called again without IO_URING_F_NONBLOCK in flags.
(So there's no need to try to add a form of polling, although that is
possible if we ever become able to do that; I'll just forget about this
and be happy this part is easy)


That just leaves deciding if a filesystem handles the blocking variant
or not; ideally if we can know early (prep time) we can even mark
REQ_F_FORCE_ASYNC in flags to skip the non-blocking call for filesystems
that don't handle that and we get the best of both worlds.

I've had a second look and I still don't see anything obvious though;
I'd rather avoid adding a new variant of iterate()/iterate_shared() --
we could use that as a chance to add a flag to struct file_operation
instead? e.g., something like mmap_supported_flags:

and fix all usages of iterate_shared.

I guess at this rate it might make sense to rename mmap_supported_flags
to some more generic supported_flags instead?...

It's a bit more than I have signed up for, but I guess it's still
reasonable enough. I'll wait for feedback before doing it though; please
say if this sounds good to you and I'll send a v2 with such a flag, as
well as adding flags to dir_context as you had suggested.

Thanks,
