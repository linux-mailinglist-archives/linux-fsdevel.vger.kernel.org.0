Could be completely wrong, but I'm inferring you've read more
linux-nfs email (particularly about alternative directions for
implementation) than looked at the localio code.  But more below.

Thanks for sharing all this about IRIX, really helpful.

IRIX sounds well engineered.  The Linux NFS code's interfaces aren't
so clean/precise.  The data structures are pretty tightly coupled (one
big struct nfs_client, nfs_server, nfsd_net, etc.  sunrpc's svc_rqst
in particular carries auth info that is used as part of the the wire
protocol business end -- so NFS auth is in the layer localio wants to
bypass).  And as such interfaces tend to do a lot of different tasks
on behalf of structures that carry the kitchen sink.

So retrofitting the Linux NFS and RPC code to allow a subset of the
NFS client and server code to be used isn't so clean.

But what you described IRIX did is pretty much what my localio series
provides, see:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/log/?h=nfs-localio-for-next

(Always room for improvement, like I said to Christoph, especially on
the IO submission and handling side.. as you've seen it is doing
buffered IO and is synchronous.. really leaving performance lackluster
but lots of upside to be had making it async and support DIO).

pNFS doesn't need to have a direct role in any of this localio code,
but pNFS can use localio if it is enabled, e.g.:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=nfs-localio-for-next&id=5e7bf77fbbecdbea0e6ae7174c97a69b11e3098a

Localio not being tightly coupled to pNFS enables localio to easily
support NFSv3.  NFSv3 support is a requirement and there is no reason
not to support it.

Anyway, I really think Neil's ideas for localio improvement are solid.
Especially factoring out the auth_domain to ensure bog standard NFS
authentication and security mechanisms used.  Though IMO the proposed
localio protocol changes aren't _really_ needed, but I also won't
fight to stop localio nfsd UUID sharing being more ephemeral and
risk-averse...

The only reason there is a sideband/auxilliary "localio protocol" is
the NFS protocol is very focused on enabling NFS spec implementation.
I actually framed it in terms of NFS encode and decode on the server
side and Chuck wanted me to make sure to decouple localio so that it
stood on its own (I agree with him, I just didn't think to do it that
way).  I just needed a a means to generate and get a UUID from the
server to anchor the mechanism for nfs_common to allow the client and
server to rendezvous, see:

nfs_common:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=nfs-localio-for-next&id=cb542e791eda114adcc9291feb6c66a5ea338f7c
nfs server:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=nfs-localio-for-next&id=877a8212c3af37b5ba32959275f4c49bfe805f24
nfs client:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=nfs-localio-for-next&id=572b36de2bb1dde06d6da4488686c9fbbc79d7e1

Really quite simple.

And the pgio hooks used to branch to localio handling of READ, WRITE and
COMMIT are the interface point for then generating a kiocb and issuing
the IO accordingly (last 2 commits below):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=nfs-localio-for-next&id=46569e6d92a074188bb1f0090d36c327729ab418

But even the buffered and direct IO in nfsd are really tightly coupled
to the wire protocol interface.  So localio hooks pgio and calls down
to the underlying filesystem with its own side channel (that uses
.read_iter and .write_iter), see fs/nfs/localio.c
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=nfs-localio-for-next&id=877a8212c3af37b5ba32959275f4c49bfe805f24
