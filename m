I happened to be looking at implementing WRITE_ZEROES support for DM
thinp yesterday and reached the same conclussion relative to it (both
of Joe's points above, for me "ii)" was: the dm-bio-prison-v1 range
locking we do for discards needs work for other types of IO).

We can work to make REQ_OP_PROVISION spanning multiple thinp blocks
possible as follow-on optimization; but in the near-term DM thinp
needs REQ_OP_PROVISION to be split on a thinp block boundary.

This splitting can be assisted by block core in terms of a new
'provision_granularity' (which for thinp, it'd be set to the thinp
blocksize).  But I don't know that we need to go that far (I'm
thinking its fine to have DM do the splitting it needs and only
elevate related code to block core if/when needed in the future).

DM core can take on conditionally imposing its max_io_len() to handle
splitting REQ_OP_PROVISION as needed on a per-target basis. This DM
core commit I've staged for 6.4 makes this quite a simple change:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-6.4&id=13f6facf3faeed34ca381aef4c9b153c7aed3972

So please rebase on linux-dm.git's dm-6.4 branch, and for
REQ_OP_PROVISION dm.c:__process_abnormal_io() you'd add this:

	case REQ_OP_PROVISION:
                num_bios = ti->num_provision_bios;
                if (ti->max_provision_granularity)
                        max_granularity = limits->max_provision_sectors;
                break;

I'll reply again later today (to patch 2's actual code changes),
because I caught at least one other thing worth mentioning.

Thanks,
Mike
