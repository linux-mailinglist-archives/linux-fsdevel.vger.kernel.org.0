I'm not talking about "multi-device" block devices like we build
with DM or MD to present a single stacked block device to the
filesystem. I'm talking about the fact that both btrfs and XFS
support multiple *independent* block devices in the one filesystem.

i.e.:

# mkfs.xfs -r rtdev=/dev/nvme0n1 -l logdev=/dev/nvme1n1,size=2000m /dev/nvme2n1
meta-data=/dev/nvme2n1           isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=22893287 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=0
         =                       reflink=0    bigtime=1 inobtcount=1 nrext64=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=91573146, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0, ftype=1
log      =/dev/nvme1n1           bsize=4096   blocks=512000, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =/dev/nvme0n1           extsz=4096   blocks=91573146, rtextents=91573146
#

This builds an XFS filesystem which can write file data to either
/dev/nvme0n1 or /dev/nvme2n1, and journal IO will get sent to a
third block dev (/dev/nvme1n1).

So, which block device do we map for the DMA buffers that contain
the file data for any given file in that filesystem? There is no
guarantee that is is sb->s_bdev, because it only points at one of
the two block devices that can contain file data.

Btrfs is similar, but it might stripe data across /dev/nvme0n1,
/dev/nvme1n1 and /dev/nvme2n1 for a single file writes (and hence
reads) and so needs separate DMA mappings for each block device just
to do IO direct to/from one file....

Indeed, for XFS there's no requirement that the block devices have
the same capabilities or even storage types - the rtdev could be
spinning disks, the logdev an nvme SSD, and the datadev is pmem. If
XFs has to do something special, it queries the bdev it needs to
operate on (e.g. DAX mappings are only allowed on pmem based
devices).

Hence it is invalid to assume that sb->s_bdev points at the actual
block device the data for any given regular file is stored on. It is
also invalid to assume the characteristics of the device in
sb->s_bdev are common for all files in the filesystem.

IOWs, the only way you can make something like this work via
filesystem mapping infrastructure to translate file offset to
to a {dev, dev_offset} tuple to tell you what persistently mapped
device buffers you need to use for IO to the given file {offset,len}
range that IO needs to be done on....

Cheers,

Dave.
