exec_folio_order() is defined per-architecture and SZ_64K is the arm64 preferred
size. At the moment x86 is not opted in, but they could choose to opt in with
32K (or whatever else makese sense) if the HW supports coalescing.

I'm not sure if you thought this was global and are arguing against that, or if
you are arguing for it to be global because it will more easily show us
performance regressions earlier if x86 is doing this too?
