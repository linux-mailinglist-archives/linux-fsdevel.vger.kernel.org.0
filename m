The requirements generally care about resource access. File open, connect, 
accept, etc. We don't care about read/write itself as that would flood the 
analysis.

I'd say maybe a quarter to a third look interesting.

There is that...

People that care about auditing are under regulatory mandates. They care more 
about the audit event than the performance. Imagine you have a system with 
some brand new medical discovery. You want to know anyone who accesses the 
information in case it gets leaked out. You don't care how slow the system 
gets - you simply *have* to know everyone who's looked at the documents.
