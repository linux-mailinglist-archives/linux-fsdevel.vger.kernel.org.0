That's just an invitation for bugs and maintenance headaches. Just call
vfs_getattr_nosec() directly and measure the performance impact before
trying to optimize this. If you see performance impact that is worth
mentioning then we can explore other options such as allowing
->getattr() to only query for i_version and nothing else.
