Yes, I agree that most of the WARN_ONs should be WARN_ON_ONCEs.  I think I've
been assuming that WARN_ON is significantly more lightweight than WARN_ON_ONCE.
But that doesn't seem to be the case, especially since commit 19d436268dde
("debug: Add _ONCE() logic to report_bug()").

But besides that, I believe WARN* is generally being used appropriately in
fs/crypto/.  It's used when assumptions made by the code are violated, but where
the hard crash of a BUG() is not necessary.  I think this is a good thing to
have, versus the alternative of doing nothing and making it much harder to track
down bugs...  Some particularly bad crypto bugs that we can easily WARN about,
such as IVs being truncated, may not even be detectable by users otherwise.

There are probably a few that should be removed, though.  I'm also considering
whether the refcounting-related ones should use CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION, though
that may run afoul of the "don't use BUG() unless absolutely needed" rule...
