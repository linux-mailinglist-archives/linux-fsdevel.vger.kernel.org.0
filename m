Yes, io_kiocb has room. Cache-locality wise whether that is fine or
it must be placed within io_rw - I'll come to know once I get to
implement this. Please share the idea you have, it can come handy.

I was thinking about both read-from (submission) and write-to
(completion) from user-space pointer, and all those checks APIs
(get_user, copy_from_user) perform.....but when seen against I/O (that
too direct), it does look small. Down the line it may matter for cached-IO
but I get your point.

Right. But it is part of SQE/CQE currently, and in new scheme it gets
decoupled and needs to be managed separately.

Would you want that new flag to do what RWF_APPEND does as well? 
In v2, we had a separate flag RWF_ZONE_APPEND and did not use
file-append infra at all. Thought was: apps using the new flag will
always look at where write landed.

In v3, I've been looking at this as: 
zone-append = file-append + something-extra-to-know-where-write-landed.
We see to it that something-extra does not get executed for regular
files/block-dev append (ref: FMODE_ZONE_APPEND patch1)....and existing
behavior (the one you described for logging application) is retained.
But on a zoned-device/file, file-append becomes zone-append, all the
time.
