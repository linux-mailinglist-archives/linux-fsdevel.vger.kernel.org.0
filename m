Jan,

thx a lot for this lead. I will study it further. Your answer made me
realized that the meaning of direct reclaim was not crystal clear to
me. I'll return to my Bovet & Cesati book to clear that out (That is
probably the book in my bookshelf that I have read the most).

After having sending out my question, I have came up with another
possible explanation...

Maybe it is not so much to send the killing signal to the oom victim
that requires GFP_FS but maybe the trouble the condition is avoiding is
the oom victim process trying to return memory to VFS as it exits while
VFS is busy waiting for its allocation request to succeed...
