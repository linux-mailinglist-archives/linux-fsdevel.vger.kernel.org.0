When I introduced NOWAIT, it was only meant for writes and for those
which would block on block allocations or locking. Over time it was
included for buffered reads as well.

BTRFS COW path would allocate blocks and the reason it returns -EAGAIN.

Yes, I agree. It was based on the initial definition and now can be
removed.
