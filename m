That's what GFP_NOFS does. We already rely on kswapd to do inode
reclaim rather than direct reclaim when filesystem cache pressure
is driving memory reclaim...

No. When ->evict_inode is called, the inode hasn't been taken off
the inode hash list. Hence the inode can still be found
via cache lookups whilst evict_inode() is running. However, the
inode will have I_FREEING set, so lookups will call
wait_on_freeing_inode() before retrying the lookup. They will
get woken by the inode_wake_up_bit() call in evict() that happens
after ->evict_inode returns, so I_FREEING is what provides
->evict_inode serialisation against new lookups trying to recreate
the inode whilst it is being torn down.

IOWs, nothing should be reconstructing the inode whilst evict() is
tearing it down because it can still be found in the inode hash.

There is no need to do that.

If we push the last half of evict_inode() out to the background
thread (i.e. go async before remove_inode_hash() is called), then
new lookups will still serialise on the inode hash due to I_FREEING
being set. i.e. Problems only arise if the inode is removed from
lookup visibility whilst they still have cleanup work pending.

e.g. have the filesystem provide a ->evict_inode_async() method
that either completes inode eviction directly or punts it to a
workqueue where it does the work and then completes inode eviction.
As long as all this work is done whilst the inode is marked
I_FREEING and is present in the inode hash, then new lookups will
serialise on the eviction work regardless of how it is scheduled.

It is likely we could simplify the XFS code by converting it over to
a mechanism like this, rather than playing the long-standing "defer
everything to background threads from ->destroy_inode()" game that
we current do.

-Dave.
