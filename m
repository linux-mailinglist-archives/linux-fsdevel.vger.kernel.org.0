I find it somewhat arbitrary that we choose to align the 2nd pointer and
not the first. Obviously it'll be easy to detect which one of the 2 is
unaligned and align it so that from thereon memcmp can continue doing
aligned accesses. However, this means a check like that would be done
for *every* (well, barring some threshold value) access to memcmp.

So you are saying that the current memcmp could indeed use improvement
but you don't want it to be based on the glibc's code due to the ugly
misalignment handling?

So you are suggesting keeping the current byte comparison one aka
'naive' and having another, more optimized generic implementation that
should be selected by GENERIC_MEMCMP or have I misunderstood you ?
