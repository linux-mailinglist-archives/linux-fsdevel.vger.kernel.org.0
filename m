It is not yet clear to me. EVM will be seeing the creation of a new 
file, and for new files setting xattrs is already allowed.

Maybe the security_inode_copy_up*() would be useful for IMA/EVM to 
authorize writes by overlayfs, which would be otherwise denied to the 
others (according to my solution).

Still, would like to hear Mimi's opinion.
