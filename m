It would also solve it for writes which is what my kiocb_modified()
comment was about. So right now you have:

kiocb_modified(IOCB_NOWAI)
-> file_modified_flags(IOCB_NOWAI)
   -> file_remove_privs(IOCB_NOWAIT) // already fully non-blocking
   -> file_accessed(IOCB_NOWAIT)
      -> i_op->update_time(S_ATIME | S_NOWAIT)

and since xfs_file_write_iter() calls xfs_file_write_checks() before
doing any actual work you'd now be fine.

For reads xfs_file_read_iter() would need to be changed to a similar
logic but that's for xfs to decide ultimately.

I would prefer 2) which seems cleaner to me. But I might miss why this
won't work. So input needed/wanted.
