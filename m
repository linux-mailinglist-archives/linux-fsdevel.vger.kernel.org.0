I think it isn't opposite direction, it is just that sink may be
WRITE to buffer, and the model is:

device(produce buffer in ->splice_read()) -> direct pipe ->
	file(consume buffer via READ or WRITE)

Follows kernel side implementation:

	splice_direct_to_actor(pipe, sd, source_actor)

	direct_actor():
		__splice_from_pipe(pipe, sd, sink_actor)

	sink_actor():
		get_page()

then read from file/socket to page.

The current userspace owns the whole buffer, so I understand the buffer
ownership can be transferred to consumer/sink side.

The added SPLICE_F_PRIV_FOR_READ[WRITE] is enough to avoid
un-expected READ, but the source end needs to confirm the buffer
ownership can be transferred to consumer, probably PIPE_BUF_FLAG_GIFT
can be used for this purpose.

I understand it isn't one issue from block device driver viewpoint at
least, since the WRITE to buffer in sink end can be thought as DMA
to buffer from device, and it is the upper layer(FS)'s responsibility
for updating page flag. And block driver needn't to handle page
status update.

So seems it is one fuse specific issue?


Thanks,
Ming
