Yes, it could provided fsopen() was called in a user namespace that the
service holds privileges over.

So there are two sides on how to view this:

(1) The filesystem is mountable   in a user namespace.
(2) The filesystem is delegatable to a user namespace.

These are two different things. Allowing (1) is difficult because of the
usual complexities involved even though everyone always seems to believe
that their block-based filesystems is reliable enough to be mounted with
any corrupted image.

But (2) is something that's doable and in fact something we do allow
currently for e.g., bpffs. In order to allow containers to use bpf the
container must have a bpffs instance mounted.

To do this fsopen() must be called in the containers user namespace. To
allow specific bpf features and to actually create the superblock
CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_BPF in the initial users namespace are required.
Then a new bpf instance will be created that is owned by the user
namespace of the container.

IOW, to delegate a superblock/filesystems to an unprivileged container
capabilities are still required but ultimately the filesystems will be
owned by the container.

One story I always found worth exploring to get at (1) is if we had
dm-verity directly integrated into the filesystem. And I don't mean
fsverity, I mean dm-verity and in a way such that it's explicitly not
part of the on-disk image in contrast to fsverity where each filesystem
integrates this very differently into their on-disk format. It basically
would be as dumb as it gets. Static, simple arithmetic, appended,
pre-pended, whatever.

Remind me why the FUSE server would want to track the userns?
