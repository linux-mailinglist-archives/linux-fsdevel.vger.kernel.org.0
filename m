I really don't expect this to be perfect right off the bat and it's
perfectly understandable to not get all the details right if you haven't
been exposed to the customs of a specific subsystems. So no worries
there and I'm well aware of that. I probably couldn't tell head from toe
in some parts of bpf.

For bpf pinning things are a little simpler because it really is just an
exclusive file create/file mknodat with preset mode so you don't really
have to worry about general lookup like e.g., io_uring does. So we
should've reached peak complexity for you in supporting basic *at()
functionality.

Btw, looking at bpf_obj_do_pin() you call security_path_mknod() before
you verify that you're dealing with a bpf file. Might be simpler to
check that this is a bpf file first and don't trigger an LSM check on
something that you don't own:
