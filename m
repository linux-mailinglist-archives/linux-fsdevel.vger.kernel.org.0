Ah I see your point, thanks.  I think you're right:

Reviewed-by: Peter Xu <peterx@redhat.com>

Would you mind adding something like above into the commit message if you're
going to repost?  IMHO it would even be nicer to mention why
UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT does not need this extra wakeup (I think it's because it'll
do the wakeup unconditionally anyway).
