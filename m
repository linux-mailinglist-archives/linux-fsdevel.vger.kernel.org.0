These may be poor examples, but hear me out...

In the case of an open call, I'm guessing that they are mapped 1:1
syscall to io_uring action so that the action can be asynchronous.  So
in this case, there is a record of the action, but we don't see the
result success/failure.  I assume that file paths can only be specified
in the original syscall and not in an SQPOLL action?

In the case of a syscall read/write (which aren't as interesting
generally to audit, but I'm concerned there are other similar situations
that are), the syscall would be called for every buffer that is passed
back and forth user/kernel and vice versa, providing a way to log all
that activity.  In the case of SQPOLL, I understand that a syscall sets
up the action and then io_uring takes over and does the bulk transfer
and we'd not have the visibility of how many times that action was
repeated nor that the result success/failure was due to its asynchrony.

Perhaps I am showing my ignorance, so please correct me if I have it
wrong.

Paul addressed this in his reply, but let me add a more concrete
example...  There was one corner case I was looking at that showed up
this issue.  Please indicate if I have mischaracterized or
misunderstood.

A syscall would generate records something like this:

	AUDIT_SYSCALL
	AUDIT_...
	AUDIT_EOE

A io_uring SQPOLL event would generate something like this:

	AUDIT_URINGOP
	AUDIT_...
	AUDIT_EOE

The "hybrid" event that is a syscall that starts an io_uring action
would generate something like this:

	AUDIT_URINGOP
	[possible AUDIT_CONFIG_CHANGE (from killed_trees)]
	AUDIT_SYSCALL
	AUDIT_...
	AUDIT_EOE

The AUDIT_... is all the operation-specific records that log parameters
that aren't able to be expressed in the SYSLOG or URINGOP records such
as pathnames, other arguments, and context (pwd, etc...).  So this isn't
"double logging".  It is either introducing an io_uring event, or it is
providing more detail about the io_uring arguments to a syscall event.
