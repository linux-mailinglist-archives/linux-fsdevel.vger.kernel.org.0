Ok, I'm really confused now.  The way I understood Anuj was that this
is NOT about block level metadata, but about other uses of the big SQE.

Which version is right?  Or did I just completely misunderstand Anuj?

And this sounds like what you refer to is not actually block metadata
as in this patchset or nvme, (or weirdly enough integrity in the block
layer code).

And while I don't understand how this threads in with the previous
statements, this makes sense.  If you only want to send a pointer (+len)
to metadata you can use the normal 64-byte SQE.  If you want to send
a PI tuple you need SEQ128.  Is that what the various above statements
try to express?  If so the right API to me would be to have two flags:

 - a flag that a pointer to metadata is passed.  This can work with
   a 64-bit SQE.
 - another flag that a PI tuple is passed.  This requires a 128-byte
   and also the previous flag.
