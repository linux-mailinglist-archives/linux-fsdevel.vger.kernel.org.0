Subject: [PATCH 2/4] namespace: only take read lock in do_reconfigure_mnt()

do_reconfigure_mnt() used to take the down_write(&sb->s_umount) lock
which seems unnecessary since we're not changing the superblock. We're
only checking whether it is already read-only. Setting other mount
attributes is protected by lock_mount_hash() afaict and not by s_umount.

So I think the history of down_write(&sb->s_umount) lock being taken
when setting mount attributes dates back to the introduction of
MNT_READONLY in [2]. Afaict, this introduced the concept of having
read-only mounts in contrast to just having a read-only superblock. When
it got introduced it was simply plumbed into do_remount() which already
took down_write(&sb->s_umount) because it was only used to actually
change the superblock before [2]. Afaict, it would've already been
possible back then to only use down_read(&sb->s_umount) for
MS_BIND | MS_REMOUNT since actual mount options were protected by
the vfsmount lock already. But that would've meant special casing the
locking for MS_BIND | MS_REMOUNT in do_remount() which people might not
have considered worth it.
Then in [1] MS_BIND | MS_REMOUNT mount option changes were split out of
do_remount() into do_reconfigure_mnt() but the down_write(&sb->s_umount)
lock was simply copied over.
Now that we have this be a separate helper only take
the down_read(&sb->s_umount) lock since we're only interested in
checking whether the super block is currently read-only and blocking any
writers from changing it. Essentially, checking that the super block is
read-only has the advantage that we can avoid having to go into the
slowpath and through MNT_WRITE_HOLD and can simply set the read-only
flag on the mount in set_mount_attributes().

[2]: commit 2e4b7fcd9260 ("[PATCH] r/o bind mounts: honor mount writer counts at remount")
