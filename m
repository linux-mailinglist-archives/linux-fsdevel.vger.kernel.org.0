Two closing thoughts:

(1) I wonder if this won't cause userspace regressions for the semantics
    of epoll because dying files are now silently ignored whereas before
    they'd generated events.

(2) The other part is that this seems to me that epoll() will now
    temporarly pin filesystems opening up the possibility for spurious
    EBUSY errors.

    If you register a file descriptor in an epoll instance and then
    close it and umount the filesystem but epoll managed to do an fget()
    on that fd before that close() call then epoll will pin that
    filesystem.

    If the f_op->poll() method does something that can take a while
    (blocks on a shared mutex of that subsystem) that umount is very
    likely going to return EBUSY suddenly.

    Afaict, before that this wouldn't have been an issue at all and is
    likely more serious than performance.

    (One option would be to only do epi_fget() for stuff like
    dma-buf that's never unmounted. That'll cover nearly every
    driver out there. Only "real" filesystems would have to contend with
    @file count going to zero but honestly they also deal with dentry
    lookup under RCU which is way more adventurous than this.)

    Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree though.
