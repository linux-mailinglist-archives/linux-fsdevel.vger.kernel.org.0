Right.  iomap will get very very confused if you switch file IO paths on
a live file.  I think it's /possible/ to switch if you flush and
truncate the whole page cache while holding inode_lock() but I don't
think anyone has ever tried.

Yes, I think it's possible to put the iomap stuff in a separate struct
within that union so that we're not increasing the fuse_inode size
unnecessarily.  That's desirable for something to do before merging,
but for now prototyping is /much/ easier if I don't have to do that.

Making that change will require a lot of careful auditing, first I want
to make sure you all agree with the iomap approach because it's much
different from what I see in the other fuse IO paths. :)

Eeeyiks, struct fuse_inode shrinks from 1272 bytes to 1152 if I push the
iomap stuff into its own union struct.

That was a deliberate design decision on my part -- maybe a fuse server
would be capable of serving up some files from a local disk, and others
from (say) a network filesystem.  Or maybe it would like to expose an
administrative fd for the filesystem (like the xfs_healer event stream)
that isn't backed by storage.

I was thinking about combining FUSE_ATTR_IOMAP_(DIRECTIO|FILEIO) for the
next RFC because I can't imagine any scenario where you don't want
directio support if you already use iomap for the pagecache.  fuse iomap
requires directio write support for writeback, so the server *must*
support IOMAP_WRITE|IOMAP_DIRECT.

Hrmm.  Is FOPEN_DIRECT_IO the magic flag that fuse passes to the fuse
server to tell it that a file is open in directio mode?  There's a few
fstests that initiate aio+dio writes to a dm-error device that currently
fail in non-iomap mode because fuse2fs writes everything to the bdev
pagecache.

I don't touch ff->iomode because iomap is a per-inode property, not a
per-file property... but I suppose that would be a good place to look.

Thank you for the feedback!
