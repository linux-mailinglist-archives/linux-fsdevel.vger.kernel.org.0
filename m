Regardless of the bigger changes discussed below, should we change
direct comparison to ESTALE to retry_estale(retval, lookup_flags) in
filename_lookup() and filename_parentat() (and probably also
do_filp_open() and do_file_open_root())? At least it won't do two
consecutive LOOKUP_REVAL lookups and the change is trivial.

The current series does not make it worse though. I'm happy to work on
further improvements with some guidance, but hopefully in a separate
patchset?

Will that allow to get rid of the retries completely? I'm not sure I
understand all the code paths that can return ESTALE, I'd assume we'd
still have to keep the whole retry logic.
