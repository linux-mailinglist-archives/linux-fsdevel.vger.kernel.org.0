I stared at the io_uring code for a while, and I'm wondering if we're
approaching this the wrong way. It seems to me that most of the
complications here come from the fact that io_uring SQEs don't clearly
belong to any particular security principle.  (We have struct creds,
but we don't really have a task or mm.)  But I'm also not convinced
that io_uring actually supports cross-mm submission except by accident
-- as it stands, unless a user is very careful to only submit SQEs
that don't use user pointers, the results will be unpredictable.
Perhaps we can get away with this:

If we can do that, then we could bind seccomp-like io_uring filters to
an mm, and we get obvious semantics that ought to cover most of the
bases.

Jens, Christoph?

Stefano, what's your intended usecase for your restriction patchset?
