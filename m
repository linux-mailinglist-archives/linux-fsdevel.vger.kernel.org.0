And the problem with that is?

I mean, look at what xfs_file_buffered_write() does to get the
xfs_inode 10 lines about that change:

xfs_file_buffered_write(
        struct kiocb            *iocb,
        struct iov_iter         *from)
{
        struct file             *file = iocb->ki_filp;
        struct address_space    *mapping = file->f_mapping;
        struct inode            *inode = mapping->host;
        struct xfs_inode        *ip = XFS_I(inode);

In what cases does file_inode(iocb->ki_filp) point to a different
inode than iocb->ki_filp->f_mapping->host? The dio write path assumes
that file_inode(iocb->ki_filp) is correct, as do both the buffered
and dio read paths.

What makes the buffered write path special in that
file_inode(iocb->ki_filp) is not correctly set whilst
iocb->ki_filp->f_mapping->host is?

Regardless, if this is a problem, then just pass the XFS inode to
xfs_ilock_iocb() and this is a moot point.

We don't need a new helper here, either.

Cheers,
