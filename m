Please enforce that in order to use a token the caller must be in the
same user namespace as the token as well. IOW, we don't want to yet make
it possible to use a token created in an ancestor user namespace to load
or attach bpf programs in a descendant user namespace. Let's be as
restrictive as we can: tokens are only valid within the user namespace
they were created in.
