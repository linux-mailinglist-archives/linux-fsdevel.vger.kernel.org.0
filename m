A bit out of topic (although I'm not quite look into FUSE BPF internals)
After roughly listening to this topic in FS track last week, I'm not
quite sure (at least in the long term) if it might be better if
ebpf-related filter/redirect stuffs could be landed in vfs or in a
somewhat stackable fs so that we could redirect/filter any sub-fstree
in principle?    It's just an open question and I have no real tendency
of this but do we really need a BPF-filter functionality for each
individual fs?

It sounds much like
